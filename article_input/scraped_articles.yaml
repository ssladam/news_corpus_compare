    text: "According to the mailer, images of which were shown to BuzzFeed News, it\u2019\
      s paid advertising from Ohio Conservatives for a Change, a super PAC supporting\
      \ Mike DeWine, the state\u2019s attorney general, over Taylor in the May 8 primary.\
      \ Kasich is seen backing a toy car away from the White House, with a photo of\
      \ Taylor\u2019s face on the trunk above a \u201CKasich 16\u201D bumper sticker.\n\
      \n\u201CWe stopped John Kasich short of the White House,\u201D reads literature\
      \ that sources said landed this week in voters\u2019 mailboxes. \u201CNow we\
      \ must stop Mary Taylor short of the governor\u2019s office.\u201D\n\nA group\
      \ invested in Ohio politics is torching outgoing Republican Gov. John Kasich\
      \ and, by association, the lieutenant governor Kasich has endorsed as his successor.\n\
      \nThe language is similar to images the PAC has been running on social media\
      \ this week.\n\nReached Tuesday night, an official with Ohio Conservatives for\
      \ a Change deferred questions to a spokesperson. The spokesperson did not immediately\
      \ respond to requests for comment.\n\n.@MaryTaylorOH supported John Kasich\u2019\
      s bid for president and touted her experience working \u201Chand in hand\u201D\
      \ with him. Taylor wanted Kasich in the White House, not President Trump. #OHGov\
      \ https://t.co/gJIrh2NbSn\n\nKasich has a complicated relationship with his\
      \ party after his unsuccessful campaign for president in 2016 and his subsequent\
      \ refusal to support eventual nominee Donald Trump. Kasich has remained a prominent\
      \ Trump critic and is considering challenging him in 2020.\n\n\n\nDeWine and\
      \ Kasich have a cordial relationship, and one of Kasich\u2019s former top political\
      \ aides is managing DeWine\u2019s campaign; DeWine also endorsed Kasich's presidential\
      \ bid during the primary. Members of Kasich\u2019s team aren\u2019t happy about\
      \ the mailer.\n\nJohn Weaver, Kasich's political consultant, questioned whether\
      \ it was wise for DeWine allies to upset a governor who remains popular in the\
      \ state and could be a campaign asset in the general election, should DeWine\
      \ win the primary. (A recent poll showed him far ahead of Taylor.)\n\n\"There's\
      \ a deep blue tsunami coming, so I guess they don't need a life raft,\u201D\
      \ Weaver told BuzzFeed News.\n\nRyan Stubenrauch, DeWine\u2019s spokesperson,\
      \ said the sentiments in the mailer \u201Cobviously don\u2019t reflect Mike\
      \ DeWine\u2019s views\u201D and that the campaign can\u2019t control what the\
      \ super PAC does.\n\n\u201CThis race isn\u2019t about John Kasich or anyone\
      \ else,\u201D Stubenrauch added. \u201CIt\u2019s about who has a vision for\
      \ Ohio that will bring more high-paying jobs and an end to the opioid epidemic.\u201D\
      \n\nTaylor was an enthusiastic supporter of Kasich\u2019s presidential bid,\
      \ and Kasich in turn was an early supporter of her gubernatorial run. But in\
      \ recent months she has attempted to downplay Kasich\u2019s endorsement and\
      \ run from certain parts of his record as governor. In a two-way race that has\
      \ become particularly nasty in the last week \u2014 with a pro-Taylor super\
      \ PAC launching an ad attack and DeWine\u2019s campaign hitting back \u2014\
      \ she is positioning herself as the true conservative, and that means putting\
      \ distance between herself and Kasich.\n\n\u201CFirst, Mary Taylor has been\
      \ very vocal on where she disagrees with John Kasich on policy and his departure\
      \ from conservative ideals,\u201D Michael Duchesne, a spokesperson for Taylor\u2019\
      s campaign, said Tuesday night when asked about the mailer. \u201CSecond, they\
      \ need a better vendor. No amount of amateurish photoshopping can hide Mike\
      \ DeWine's liberal positions.\u201D"

    text: "\"The threat is there \u2014 and ignoring it isn\u2019t going to make it\
      \ go away.\"\n\nTo Shauna Daly, a veteran Democratic operative, the idea seemed\
      \ like an obvious answer to an urgent problem in the months after the 2016 election:\
      \ a new nonprofit that could help campaigns guard against hacks and share critical\
      \ threat intelligence.\n\nAt the time, US officials were detailing the extent\
      \ to which Russians had launched a series of massive cyberattacks across the\
      \ party. Operatives who\u2019d lived through the hacks looked back on 2016 as\
      \ a traumatic event: Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta, saw\
      \ a decade\u2019s worth of personal emails exposed. At the Democratic National\
      \ Committee, staffers became scared and paranoid. The office was swept for bugs.\
      \ Next door, at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 the arm\
      \ of the party tasked with electing House candidates \u2014 officials spent\
      \ the final three months of the election in a state of blind panic, with nothing\
      \ to do but wait as Russian hackers operating as \u201CGuccifer 2.0\u201D leaked\
      \ a new cache of stolen documents every few days. So last year, when Daly and\
      \ her cofounder launched the Progressive Security Corps, they believed donors\
      \ and campaigns would see cybersecurity as a top priority. \u201CIt just turned\
      \ out that that wasn't really the case,\u201D she said in an interview. Not\
      \ only has Daly, a former research director at the DNC, been unable to secure\
      \ funding for the project \u2014 she\u2019s had trouble generating interest\
      \ at all. At panel discussions on the topic of cybersecurity and campaigns,\
      \ she said, \u201Cturnout is low \u2014 and it\u2019s a self-selected group\
      \ of people who come. Unless people are really interested in it, they don\u2019\
      t come.\u201D Seven months from the next election, US officials agree that hackers\
      \ pose an imminent threat to 2018 campaigns. And yet Daly and other concerned\
      \ operatives see a troubling pattern across the Democratic Party: While some\
      \ campaigns have taken steps to shore up their security, far too many simply\
      \ don\u2019t care enough to meaningfully change their practices. And, even more\
      \ alarming to some, there\u2019s been no hardline effort by party committees\
      \ like the DCCC to enforce its own recommendations on cybersecurity. \u201C\
      How do you get people to be interested?\u201D asked Daly. \u201CYou force them.\u201D\
      \n\nLast June, the DCCC became the first known party entity to use Wickr, a\
      \ secure workplace messaging software offering end-to-end encryption, a technology\
      \ meant to make messages indecipherable to any third party. Officials there\
      \ said they would also be extending Wickr to the staff and consultants on some\
      \ of its most competitive races, a group of incumbent Democrats known as the\
      \ DCCC\u2019s 2018 \u201CFrontline Members.\u201D\n\nBut when contacted, a number\
      \ of those Frontline campaigns said they don\u2019t have access to Wickr, or\
      \ aren\u2019t using it. Democrats in other House races, from incumbents to primary\
      \ candidates, said they haven\u2019t received cybersecurity guidance from the\
      \ DCCC. Across the board, operatives said, staffers and consultants still rely\
      \ heavily on email. \u201CWe haven\u2019t gotten that access, as far as I\u2019\
      m aware. I\u2019m not on Wickr myself,\u201D said Tess Whittlesey, a spokesperson\
      \ for one of the DCCC\u2019s Frontline candidates, Salud Carbajal, up for reelection\
      \ in California\u2019s 24th District. \u201CSo far we haven\u2019t jumped to\
      \ Wickr.\u201D Richard Ojeda, the populist candidate running in West Virginia\u2019\
      s 3rd District with little party support, said his campaign hasn\u2019t \u201C\
      heard anything concerning cybersecurity\u201D from the DCCC. The same was true\
      \ for far more prominent candidates like Rep. Eric Swalwell in California. A\
      \ spokesperson said that Swalwell has taken his own steps to secure his campaign\
      \ operation, but has \u201Cnot received any particular direction from the DCCC.\u201D\
      \ A DCCC official said that the organization did advise Frontline candidates\
      \ to sign up for Wickr last year, but that campaigns are free to use other vendors.\
      \ The committee also offered a voluntary cybersecurity briefing for candidates.\
      \ In that briefing, the official said, the DCCC laid out a number of recommendations\
      \ on cybersecurity practices. \u201CUltimately it is up to their campaign to\
      \ adopt and enforce these recommendations,\u201D the DCCC official said. The\
      \ tricky matter of enforcement raises a string of open questions heading into\
      \ the 2018 midterms: Are party committees responsible for the security of their\
      \ campaigns? (In the case of the DCCC, that means a decentralized universe of\
      \ hundreds of House races \u2014 but that leaves aside campaigns for Senate,\
      \ governor, attorney general, and state legislatures.) And can any party entity\
      \ really compel a campaign to abide by certain rules or standards? (Some operatives\
      \ who work on independent expenditure groups \u2014 PACs that operate in tandem\
      \ with but separately from the party \u2014 have discussed writing provisions\
      \ about secure technology, such as Wickr, into vendor contracts.) \u201CIt\u2019\
      s distressing to me that we\u2019re seeing people make many of the same mistakes\
      \ now that resulted in the theft of a lot of information in 2016,\u201D said\
      \ Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Robby Mook, who, after witnessing\
      \ foreign-sponsored hacks at close range, helped found Defending Digital Democracy,\
      \ a bipartisan cybersecurity project at Harvard, alongside Mitt Romney\u2019\
      s 2012 campaign manager Matt Rhoades. \u201COne organization being well-protected\
      \ is nice, but the goal is to get everybody,\u201D said Daly. \u201CIt's just\
      \ a very wide range at this point. Some are taking things very seriously, but\
      \ tons of individuals, campaigns, and organizations have done little or nothing.\u201D\
      \ Another Democratic operative put it this way: \u201CCandidates are either\
      \ very concerned about it, or they haven\u2019t even asked about it \u2014 and\
      \ there\u2019s nothing in between.\u201D\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Raffi Krikorian\
      \ arrived in Washington as the DNC\u2019s new chief technology officer, the\
      \ Silicon Valley engineer said the party needed a sweeping \u201Cculture change\u201D\
      \ around cybersecurity: \u201CIt has to be part of on-boarding,\u201D he said\
      \ last fall, six weeks into his first job in politics, \u201Cpart of every conversation,\
      \ every time we have a meeting.\u201D\n\nEnforcing that \u201Cculture change\u201D\
      \ becomes an inherently difficult task in politics, where campaigns can begin\
      \ as small shoestring operations, run from a single email account, before growing\
      \ quickly into a vast and shifting web of staffers, consultants, and volunteers\
      \ \u2014 all communicating daily, all across different mediums. For campaign\
      \ managers, if cybersecurity is a priority at all, it can quickly fall to the\
      \ bottom of the list. \u201CIt does continue to be a challenge to get people\
      \ to spend a little bit of time and focus on this,\u201D said Mook, the Defending\
      \ Digital Democracy cofounder. \u201CAnd I\u2019m incredibly sympathetic to\
      \ campaign managers who feel like they have way too much else going on to worry\
      \ about this and that there are just simply bigger priorities. I\u2019ve obviously\
      \ been there myself.\u201D Last year, Mook was among a small group of operatives\
      \ who helped introduce Wickr\u2019s CEO, Joel Wallenstrom, to political players\
      \ in Washington. After 2016, Mook said, there was an \u201Cenormous amount of\
      \ interest in the tech sector to be helpful,\u201D a sentiment that helped draw\
      \ tech figures like Krikorian, formerly of Uber and Twitter, and Bob Lord, who\
      \ joined the DNC as chief security officer after leading the same division at\
      \ Yahoo. On the political side, the response remains far more uneven.\n\nEarlier\
      \ this month, at the DNC\u2019s annual winter meeting in Washington, Lord hosted\
      \ a cybersecurity briefing for attendees. Before the presentation, party officials\
      \ were seen scanning the halls of the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, trying to\
      \ convince more people to attend. \u201CWe need you!\u201D one staffer said,\
      \ running up to a guest. \u201CWe need bodies.\u201D At Wickr, the San Francisco\u2013\
      based encryption software company, officials are attempting to bridge the political\
      \ and security worlds. By their own estimates, they are working with Democrats\
      \ and Republicans in about 10% of House races and 50% of Senate races. They\
      \ say about 70 consultants are using their software so far, including at Democratic\
      \ firms like Global Strategy Group and PACs such as House Majority. The company\
      \ recently hired Audra Grassia, an operative with extensive experience across\
      \ the Democratic Party, to help lead its efforts in politics and government.\n\
      \nAdvertisement\n\nWallenstrom, the CEO, said he believes campaigns are now\
      \ moving from the \u201Cplanning stage\u201D to thinking more seriously about\
      \ \u201Cexecution.\u201D But there\u2019s no doubt that political operatives,\
      \ candidates, and lawmakers are still working to grasp the basics of security.\
      \ (Wallenstrom says that in meetings on Capitol Hill, he still gets questions\
      \ about the company\u2019s work on voting machines \u2014 a separate threat\
      \ to the security of elections that has nothing to do with what campaigns can\
      \ do to protect their communications.) \u201CWhat I\u2019ve been encountering\
      \ is people don\u2019t understand the issue very well,\u201D said Mook. \u201C\
      They just have a lot of other things going on. But what I\u2019ve been trying\
      \ to tell people is it\u2019s there \u2014 the threat is there \u2014 and ignoring\
      \ it isn\u2019t going to make it go away.\u201D That there isn\u2019t more urgency\
      \ among political operatives about the threat of another cyberattack has been\
      \ bewildering for some watching from the outside. \u201CHacking and leaking\
      \ was probably the single most potent weapon during the campaign,\u201D said\
      \ Ben Nimmo, an information defense fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201CI\
      \ used to be a press officer. Can you imagine being a press officer for the\
      \ Clinton campaign? Waking up every morning for the month before the election\
      \ and the first thing you see is, \u2018Here\u2019s what WikiLeaks just leaked\
      \ from your campaign.\u2019 Every day, for a month. There\u2019s no way you\
      \ can generate a positive narrative or get something going when the first thing\
      \ you\u2019re doing every morning is firefighting. You can\u2019t do it.\u201D\
      \n\nFor the majority of US officials, there\u2019s no doubt that the Russian\
      \ government hacked Democratic candidates and leaked their files to hurt the\
      \ party\u2019s chances in 2016. There\u2019s also little doubt that they\u2019\
      ll be back, at least in some capacity, ahead of 2018.\n\nIn January 2017, a\
      \ rare declassified joint report from the top US intelligence agencies declared\
      \ that Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU, had, on\
      \ orders from President Vladimir Putin, broken into the email accounts of Democratic\
      \ officials in March 2016. Those files leaked online in ensuing months through\
      \ several channels, including the Guccifer 2.0 persona, who leaked candidates\u2019\
      \ opposition research files stolen from the DCCC. Researchers who track GRU\
      \ hackers say they regularly target politicians and candidates. At ThreatConnect,\
      \ a cybersecurity firm, private threat intelligence researchers say they\u2019\
      ve discovered phishing campaigns against French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019\
      s campaign, Turkey\u2019s Justice and Development Party, and the German Free\
      \ Party. Toni Gidwani, ThreatConnect\u2019s director of research operations,\
      \ said she was unaware of a campaign against a political party in which the\
      \ group was unable to get at least one person to fall for a fraudulent email.\
      \ \u201CPhishing works,\u201D Gidwani said, as does figuring out when an employee\
      \ reuses the same password they\u2019d previously set for an older, already\
      \ compromised account. \u201CThey don\u2019t have to use malware to get in,\u201D\
      \ she said. US officials expect that Russia, in particular, could strike again.\
      \ \u201CRussia is likely to continue to pursue even more aggressive cyberattacks,\u201D\
      \ Trump\u2019s Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, testified this\
      \ month. \u201CRussia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the\
      \ 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target.\u201D \u201CPresident Putin\
      \ has clearly come to the conclusion there\u2019s little price to pay here,\
      \ and that therefore [he] can continue this activity,\u201D Adm. Mike Rogers,\
      \ the director of the NSA and head of US Cyber Command, said in Senate testimony\
      \ last month. \u201CEverything both as a director of NSA and what I see on the\
      \ Cyber Command side leads me to believe that if we don\u2019t change the dynamic\
      \ here this is going to continue, and 2016 won\u2019t be viewed as something\
      \ isolated. This is something that will be sustained over time.\u201D About\
      \ a month before he was fired, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned\
      \ that the US still wasn\u2019t prepared to ward off Russian election meddling.\
      \ \u201CIf it's their intention to interfere, they're going to do that,\u201D\
      \ he said in an interview with Fox News. This month, the Treasury Department\
      \ issued sanctions against a number of Russians, including members of the GRU,\
      \ which the agency described as \u201Cdirectly involved in interfering in the\
      \ 2016 US elections through cyber-enabled activities.\u201D It\u2019s not clear\
      \ if that will deter future attacks. In a statement, California Democrat Adam\
      \ Schiff said the sanctions were \u201Ca grievous disappointment\u201D and \u201C\
      fall far short of what is needed to respond to that attack on our democracy.\u201D\
      \ Texas Republican Will Hurd said the sanctions were \u201Can important first\
      \ step, but we must continue to demonstrate to Vladimir Putin, and other bad\
      \ actors, that America won\u2019t tolerate this behavior.\u201D And the concern\
      \ isn\u2019t limited to just the GRU. The group is known for being particularly\
      \ noisy and \u201Cone of the most active adversaries,\u201D said Adam Meyers,\
      \ a researcher in the intelligence division at CrowdStrike, the firm hired to\
      \ protect the DNC. But, Meyers added, \u201Cit is equally likely that it is\
      \ one of the more visible ones\u201D \u2014 and that other effective state-sponsored\
      \ hackers simply make hiding their tracks more of a priority. Already this year,\
      \ Democrats have noticed signs of suspicious activity. Officials at EMILY\u2019\
      s List, a prominent liberal group that aims to recruit and elect pro\u2013abortion\
      \ rights women, were recently notified of a spoof account for the organization\
      \ on Facebook. Earlier this month, Democrats flagged a phishing email addressed\
      \ from a fake DNC account for Luis Miranda, an official who had his emails stolen\
      \ in the 2016 hack and is no longer working at the DNC. In North Carolina, a\
      \ congressional candidate, Democrat Linda Coleman, said that Russians had purchased\
      \ the domain for one of her old campaign websites. And in Tennessee, in what\
      \ security experts have described as perhaps the most troubling development\
      \ so far, the leading Democratic candidate for Senate, Phil Bredesen, alerted\
      \ the FBI that he had received emails from an account posing as the campaign\u2019\
      s media buyer. The sender knew the dates of a planned ad buy, leading Bredesen\
      \ aides to believe that hackers had infiltrated their campaign. Since early\
      \ March, when Bredesen\u2019s letter to the FBI became public, officials at\
      \ Wickr said they\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in interest and concern from\
      \ political campaigns. \u201CMy Wickr and my inbox have blown up, very similar\
      \ to what happens when there's a breach in the corporate world,\u201D said Wallenstrom,\
      \ who became Wickr\u2019s CEO in 2016. \u201CThe thing that was number five\
      \ on the to-do list suddenly becomes number two or one.\u201D \"Operationally\
      \ there's a little more urgency now.\u201D\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of guidance\
      \ and enforcement from entities like the DCCC highlights a fundamental difficulty\
      \ for private American organizations targeted by sophisticated and malicious\
      \ foreign hackers: Who, exactly, is responsible for keeping them safe?\n\n\u201C\
      Decades ago, as a matter of public policy, we made a decision that because the\
      \ internet is free and open and belongs to everybody \u2014 and in this country\
      \ is provided as a service by private companies \u2014 that people are going\
      \ to by and large defend themselves,\u201D said Michael Sulmeyer, a former policy\
      \ director at the Department of Defense now serving as the director of the Harvard\
      \ Belfer Center\u2019s Cyber Security Project. \u201CWe\u2019re now getting\
      \ to a point where we want to look at who is accountable for protecting the\
      \ masses.\u201D There\u2019s no government agency directly tasked with guarding\
      \ Americans from hackers, though the FBI often works as a clearinghouse for\
      \ intelligence on cyberattacks, sending alerts to Americans it sees being targeted.\
      \ In 2015, the FBI tried to notify the DNC about possible Russian activity,\
      \ but a miscommunication meant its warning wasn\u2019t heeded. \u201CThe FBI\
      \ continues to coordinate with federal and state partners not only on what transpired\
      \ in 2016, but looking forward to what may come in the 2018 election cycle,\u201D\
      \ an agency spokesperson said. At Harvard, the political operatives and tech\
      \ leaders behind Defending Digital Democracy hope to position the group as a\
      \ centralized resource for campaigns \u2014 and eventually, as a first-of-its-kind\
      \ \u201Cinformation sharing\u201D network where Democrats and Republicans can\
      \ exchange threat intelligence. \u201COur goal is to build an information-sharing\
      \ organization that includes political parties, campaigns, state and local election\
      \ officials, and tech companies,\u201D Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s chief security\
      \ officer and a member of Defending Digital Democracy\u2019s advisory board,\
      \ told Gizmodo last summer. (Stamos will leave Facebook later this year amid\
      \ questions about the company\u2019s role in the 2016 election, according to\
      \ the New York Times.) So far, Democrats and Republicans have resisted any collaboration\
      \ on cybersecurity. In 2016, the DCCC criticized its Republican counterpart,\
      \ the National Republican Congressional Committee, for using a hacked document\
      \ in a digital attack ad. After the election, when the DCCC proposed a joint\
      \ initiative to guard against cyberattacks, the NRCC responded by dismissing\
      \ the idea as a \u201Cstunt.\u201D And as Democrats spoke publicly about their\
      \ move to Wickr, Republicans made a point of keeping quiet \u2014 even as they\
      \ adopted similar security measures. \u201CThe first rule of effective cybersecurity\
      \ is not bragging about your cybersecurity procedures,\u201D NRCC spokesperson\

      \ merely a public relations issue.\u201D For operatives like Daly, there are\
      \ more immediate and basic concerns: a lack of interest, a lack of urgency,\
      \ a lack of enforcement. \u201CObviously we'd like 2018 to be a practice run\
      \ for 2020,\u201D she said. \u201CIt just matters if there's buy-in at the top.\u201D\
      \ Daly is still speaking about cybersecurity at conferences. But her audiences\
      \ are still self-selecting. And her nonprofit, the Progressive Security Corps,\
      \ is still struggling to attract enough funding and engagement to make the project\
      \ a full-time endeavor. The reality, she said, is \u201CI need to go find a\

    text: "Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, expanded her pending\
      \ lawsuit against President Donald Trump and associates, adding a claim alleging\
      \ that longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen defamed her earlier this year.\n\n\
      Clifford, the adult film performer and director who says she had a relationship\
      \ with Trump back in 2006, filed the lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have\
      \ a 2016 settlement agreement she signed with Cohen \u2014 which led to her\
      \ being paid $130,000 in exchange for her silence \u2014 tossed out as invalid.\n\
      \nOn Monday, though, Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, expanded the suit,\
      \ adding a defamation claim against Cohen based on a statement he made regarding\
      \ the payment.\n\n\"Just because something isn\u2019t true doesn\u2019t mean\
      \ that it can\u2019t cause you harm or damage,\" Cohen said in a mid-February\
      \ statement. \"I will always protect Mr. Trump.\"\n\n\n\nAvenatti points to\
      \ that statement as the basis for the defamation claim, stating in the amended\
      \ complaint, \"It was reasonably understood by those who read or heard the statement\
      \ that Mr. Cohen\u2019s defamatory statement was about Ms. Clifford.\"\n\nClifford\
      \ says that she had a relationship with Trump a little more than a decade ago\
      \ that included them having sex on one occasion. In a 60 Minutes interview that\
      \ aired Sunday night, Clifford claimed that after sitting for a magazine interview\
      \ about the relationship in 2011, which did not run at the time, she was threatened\
      \ in a Las Vegas parking lot by a man who told her, \"Leave Trump alone. Forget\
      \ the story.\" In the waning days of the 2016 election, when the topic came\
      \ up again, Clifford was offered the settlement agreement, which she agreed\
      \ to and signed.\n\n\n\nIn Cohen's February statement \u2014 which followed\
      \ Wall Street Journal and others' reporting on the payment \u2014 he said that\
      \ he \"used [his] own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to\
      \ Ms. Stephanie Clifford.\" The payment was made through Essential Consultants,\
      \ which Cohen formed, and which is one of the parties to the settlement agreement.\n\
      \nThe lawsuit, which Clifford filed in state court in California but Cohen's\
      \ lawyer removed to federal court, alleges that the settlement agreement should\
      \ be tossed out primarily because, Avenatti argues, Trump didn't sign it and\
      \ therefore no agreement was ever formed. Alternatively, Avenatti argues in\
      \ the amended complaint that the lawsuit should be found to be unenforceable\
      \ because it is unconscionable \u2014 pointing to the damages provision that\
      \ would require Clifford to pay $1 million for each breach of the confidentiality\
      \ provision \u2014 or void because it violates public policy.\n\nIn addition,\
      \ and in an expansion of the initial lawsuit, Avenatti also takes on the arbitration\
      \ requirement in the settlement. He argues that the arbitration requirement\
      \ should be tossed out as violating public policy, in part because, he argues,\
      \ \"the clause plainly is designed to prevent the public disclosure of an illegal\
      \ campaign contribution\" \u2014 a reference to the argument that Cohen's payment\
      \ could be construed as an in-kind contribution to Trump's campaign far surpassing\
      \ the legal limit \u2014 \"by mandating that disputes between Plaintiff and\
      \ Mr. Trump be resolved in a confidential arbitration proceeding shielded from\
      \ public scrutiny.\"\n\nAvenatti also argues that there is no arbitration agreement\
      \ between EC and Clifford \u2014 a ruling that would mean EC should not have\
      \ been able to seek a restraining order against Clifford in arbitration earlier\
      \ this year.\n\nCohen and his lawyers did not immediately respond to a request\
      \ for comment on the amended complaint."

    text: "The Republican officials who brought you the Iraq War \u2014 and whom Donald\
      \ Trump campaigned against in 2016 \u2014 are celebrating the revival of the\
      \ early Bush administration in a trio of key foreign policy appointments.\n\n\
      The elevation of CIA Director\u2013designate Gina Haspel, National Security\
      \ Adviser John Bolton, and Secretary of State\u2013designate Mike Pompeo represents\
      \ a return to a point of view not seen since the early 2000s: eagerness to use\
      \ American armed force, comfort with torturing terror suspects, and a central\
      \ focus on counterterror policy.\n\nIt is, one prominent neoconservative told\
      \ BuzzFeed News, \u201CChristmas for neocons.\u201D\n\nThere is no indication\
      \ that Trump was thinking deeply about history, ideology, or even policy when\
      \ he made these moves. He has an unusual level of personal comfort with Pompeo;\
      \ he liked how Bolton sounded on TV; and he was simply hard up for candidates\
      \ to lead the CIA, one top Republican foreign policy official noted.\n\nBut\
      \ the upshot of his decision is striking: Bolton, the former United Nations\
      \ ambassador, represented the bleeding edge of Bush-era unilateralism; Haspel\
      \ destroyed evidence in a torture investigation. And Pompeo, who served in the\
      \ first Gulf War, is newer to Washington but has fought hard against the Iran\
      \ nuclear deal, the central focus of neocon ire, as well as that of other Republican\
      \ hawks. Their appointments represents the revival of a school of foreign policy\
      \ that seemed to have vanished even from Republican politics during the Obama\
      \ years, and which lost further relevance when Trump ran claiming (falsely)\
      \ to have opposed the Iraq invasion.\n\nScott Jennings, who served as a political\
      \ aide in the Bush White House, said Trump\u2019s team is \u201Clearning what\
      \ it\u2019s like to operate in this world as the president\u201D after a campaign\
      \ that was hardly hawkish.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m glad the president has people there\
      \ with clear eyes about who we\u2019re dealing with,\u201D Jennings said. \u201C\
      I think it\u2019s exactly the right message: That we\u2019re serious. And when\
      \ you appoint people like Bolton, they know you\u2019re serious.\u201D\n\nA\
      \ decade ago, there was a bitter divide between neoconservatives, who spoke\
      \ idealistically of exporting democracy, and more nationalistic Republican hawks\
      \ like Bolton, whose attention ran more straightforwardly toward oil and power.\
      \ But those differences have largely been elided inside actual Republican politics\
      \ \u2014 and Trump\u2019s appointments revive in particular the ideology of\
      \ the key figures of the early Bush years, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense\
      \ Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n\u201CRumsfeld\u2019s a huge Bolton fan,\u201D\
      \ said one former Bush administration official, who said the former secretary\
      \ (who didn\u2019t respond to an email inquiry) sees Bolton as \u201Csteely-eyed.\u201D\
      \n\nRumsfeld\u2019s old internal rivals among the neocons feel the same way.\n\
      \n\u201CMaybe he\u2019s not for democracy promotion, but what\u2019s the difference?\
      \ He\u2019s our boy, he loves us, we love him; the difference has evaporated,\u201D\
      \ said the prominent neoconservative. \u201CEven if Marco Rubio was president,\
      \ would we have had these people in these national security positions? I sort\
      \ of doubt it.\u201D\n\nHaspel has also drawn lavish praise from a wing of the\
      \ party that seemed, until fairly recently, to be on the margins.\n\n\u201C\
      Gina Haspel has spent her career defending the American people and homeland,\u201D\
      \ Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the former vice president\u2019s daughter and political\
      \ successor, wrote recently, amid a string of tweets furiously attacking Haspel\u2019\
      s critics. \u201CThe Enhanced Interrogation Program saved lives, prevented attacks,\
      \ & produced intel that led to Osama bin Laden.\u201D\n\nFormer Bush aides aren\u2019\
      t entirely sure what to make of Trump\u2019s new team. After all, the president\
      \ used the Iraq legacy to tear down the former president\u2019s brother, Jeb.\
      \ \u201CI don\u2019t think Trump has put that much thought into any of this,\u201D\
      \ one noted.\n\n(Bolton declined to comment on his views of the Cheney-Rumsfeld\
      \ era. \u201CI recommend you read the Axios piece from last night,\u201D Bolton\
      \ spokesperson Garrett Marquis told BuzzFeed News in response to an inquiry,\
      \ sending on the party line that Bolton intends to be an \u201Chonest broker.\u201D\
      )\n\nBush\u2019s old critics, though, are intensely alert to the revival of\
      \ ideologies they thought Trump had finally killed off.\n\n\u201CWe are repeating\
      \ the mistakes of the past by allowing the failed foreign policies of Neocons\
      \ to infiltrate our government,\u201D libertarian-minded Kentucky Sen. Rand\
      \ Paul said Monday in an emailed statement. \u201CThese are the same people\
      \ who eagerly await the next opportunity for war. Undoubtedly, it will result\
      \ in a world with far more enemies than stability or peace.\u201D\n\n\n\n"

    text: "Anthony Gonzalez and Christina Hagan are both bright, young prospects with\
      \ starkly different styles and strategies. He has old football pal Peyton Manning\
      \ and much of the establishment on his side. She has Anthony Scaramucci and\
      \ a lineup of pro-Trump surrogates on hers. Whatever happens in the Ohio 16th\
      \ could go a long way toward understanding where the GOP is headed in the first\
      \ midterms of the Trump era.\n\nThis spring, a primary for the open House seat\
      \ here in Ohio\u2019s 16th Congressional District will help shape the Republican\
      \ Party\u2019s future \u2014 pitting the old and new versions of what it means\
      \ to be a conservative against each other. At first glance, the two main candidates\
      \ don\u2019t look so different: They\u2019re young and ambitious and would qualify\
      \ as reliably conservative. Both are part of the National Republican Congressional\
      \ Committee\u2019s recruitment program for top prospects. Both would vote for\
      \ President Trump\u2019s agenda most of the time. But by the standards of the\
      \ Trump era \u2014 where style and identity overshadow ideology and policy,\
      \ and where the lengths you go to to present yourself as a Trump loyalist often\
      \ matter more than your voting record \u2014 there are sharp differences between\
      \ Anthony Gonzalez and Christina Hagan. Gonzalez, 33, was a star wide receiver\
      \ at Ohio State and a first-round draft pick in the NFL, where he caught passes\
      \ from Peyton Manning. He later earned an MBA from Stanford and worked as a\
      \ top executive with an education technology company in Silicon Valley.\n\n\
      His first television ad? Packed with reminders of his football career. A recent\
      \ fundraiser? Headlined by Jim Tressel, the former Buckeyes head coach who remains\
      \ beloved and influential in the state. Gonzalez is counting on this hometown\
      \ hero image to carry him against his more-seasoned opponent and to make up\
      \ for his dry and cerebral personality on the campaign trail. (\u201CI was told\
      \ once never to give process answers,\u201D he confessed to an audience recently,\
      \ before launching into a process answer to a question about the national debt.)\
      \ Hagan, 29, has been a state lawmaker since her senior year at Malone, a tiny\
      \ Christian university just outside the district. She holds her father\u2019\
      s old seat, was married in a statehouse ceremony, and has fast become a career\
      \ politician despite positioning herself as an outsider in Trump\u2019s mold.\
      \ She emphasizes her family\u2019s small plumbing and heating business and serves\
      \ up other homespun anecdotes \u2014 peeling potatoes in the back of a local\
      \ diner, waiting tables even after winning a seat in the legislature \u2014\
      \ as proof of her working-class cred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer first ad showed\
      \ how comfortable she is dishing out the kind of red meat Gonzalez seldom touches.\
      \ (\u201CCalifornia and New York elites are coming for our guns right here in\
      \ Ohio,\u201D she says in the spot as she loads a shotgun.) Her fundraisers\
      \ have been headlined by pro-Trump figures of varying celebrity, from YouTube\
      \ duo Diamond and Silk to former White House advisers Sebastian Gorka and Anthony\
      \ Scaramucci. \u201CI think we have two completely different candidates,\u201D\
      \ Gonzalez said last month while speaking at a Republican club meeting in the\
      \ Cleveland suburb of Rocky River. \u201CPeople are going to have a very clear\
      \ choice, which is always good.\u201D\n\nAsked who he would look to as a congressional\
      \ role model, Gonzalez gushed about Sen. Ben Sasse, the conservative and Trump\
      \ critic from Nebraska: \u201CMy wife says I have a man crush on the guy.\u201D\
      \ Hagan dodged when offered the same question: \u201CI am going to go and uniquely\
      \ be myself.\u201D It\u2019s not difficult, though, to picture where she would\
      \ fit among her colleagues. She recently scored an endorsement from fellow Ohioan\
      \ Jim Jordan, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and one of\
      \ Trump\u2019s most pugnacious defenders in the investigation of Russian interference\
      \ in the 2016 election. Gonzalez, meanwhile, has the backing of Florida Sen.\
      \ Marco Rubio and is excited about a recent donation from House Majority Leader\
      \ Kevin McCarthy, one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nGonzalez\
      \ never explicitly draws the contrasts. \u201CI don\u2019t think about the messaging\
      \ coming out of the other side at all,\u201D he told BuzzFeed News in an interview.\
      \ Hagan is eager to do so. She frames Gonzalez as a political neophyte with\
      \ West Coast values who came home to fly the establishment flag in a campaign\
      \ built around his football glory days and a highbrow education she incorrectly\
      \ describes as Ivy League. \u201CAnthony\u2019s supporters,\u201D she said in\
      \ an interview after the Scaramucci event, \u201Cprobably have touted him for\
      \ being a Stanford graduate, and [believe] this is something we should all connect\
      \ with and understand. But also, not that many folks in Northeast Ohio have\
      \ graduated with a college degree, let alone an Ivy League degree.\u201D The\
      \ stakes here are even higher now that Democrats have scratched out a special\
      \ election win in Pennsylvania \u2014 by beating a pro-Trump Republican with\
      \ a youthful candidate in a suburban Pittsburgh district that favored Trump\
      \ by 20 points and had been in GOP hands for 15 years. At least one midterm\
      \ forecaster has moved the Ohio 16th, up for grabs because incumbent Jim Renacci\
      \ chose to run for Senate, from \u201Csafe Republican\u201D to \u201Clikely\
      \ Republican.\u201D The crowded Democratic primary lacks a big-name candidate,\
      \ though Marine Corps veteran Grant Goodrich, recently endorsed by influential\
      \ Rep. Marcia Fudge of the Cleveland area, has begun to stand out. The district\
      \ itself offers a wide array of voters: There\u2019s blue-collar suburbia, white-collar\
      \ exurbia, and a slice of farm country. Up north, just outside Cleveland, a\
      \ General Motors factory cranks out auto parts. Down south, cars share the road\
      \ with the Amish and their horse-drawn buggies. Trump won here by 16 points,\
      \ but allegiance to him might suddenly be a tricker proposition.\n\nWhen it\
      \ comes to the Trump calculus, the differences between Gonzalez and Hagan cut\
      \ both ways. He is more famous, has the business background, and has much more\
      \ cash in his campaign account. She is more charismatic and more experienced.\
      \ And in a year when a record number of women are running for Congress, Hagan\
      \ rated a Washington Post style section profile by being an unabashed supporter\
      \ of a president who\u2019s been repeatedly accused of harassing women. Hagan\
      \ also acknowledges she needs \u201Cto be a little more gutsy\u201D when asking\
      \ for money, and she says has been disappointed that so many party insiders\
      \ have told her that it\u2019s \u201Cnot your turn.\u201D If she wins, she would\
      \ be the youngest woman ever elected to the House, beating Rep. Elise Stefanik,\
      \ a New York Republican, by a few months. She clearly is the candidate most\
      \ in sync with the Trump aesthetic. She staged her February fundraiser with\
      \ Scaramucci \u2014 the Mooch, as Trump\u2019s exiled and very much in-on-the-joke\
      \ White House communications director is known \u2014 at a McMansion in exurban\
      \ Medina. Inside, a cocktail lounge pianist noodled away at \u201CHeart and\
      \ Soul\u201D and \u201CPiano Man.\u201D Guests circled through a dining room\
      \ and kitchen, munching on light hors d'oeuvres and sipping wine, Heineken,\
      \ and local craft beer. Hagan\u2019s father, the former state lawmaker, held\
      \ court in one corner, closely scanning the names of hosts on an invitation\
      \ someone had snagged for an upcoming Gonzalez event. \u201CIt\u2019s good to\
      \ see that I do have a fellow black brother in the house with me,\u201D warm-up\
      \ act Kareem Lanier, a member of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump,\
      \ told the all-white audience. \u201CMy good brother Anthony Scaramucci is black.\
      \ I won\u2019t tell you guys which half of him is black. But he is a black man,\
      \ for sure.\u201D The Mooch gave the donors almost everything they came for:\
      \ self-deprecating humor and some colorful tales from his time with Trump. (\u201C\
      Hey, Mooch, what do you want from Burger King? I\u2019m buying!\u201D) But if\
      \ all of this is meant to put the Trump imprimatur on Hagan\u2019s bid, there\u2019\
      s something missing: Trump himself. It\u2019s not as if the president is shy\
      \ about picking favorites in other tough primaries, though there has not been\
      \ reliable polling on the Ohio 16th. When one supporter asked if Trump would\
      \ visit before the May 8 vote, Scaramucci deflected, assuring the audience that\
      \ he is close with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner,\
      \ and that they are aware of Hagan\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s say\
      \ maybe,\u201D he continued, teeing up a quip about his 11-day tenure at the\
      \ White House. \u201CIf I was the communications director for 12 days, I could\
      \ have said definitely.\u201D Gonzalez shows no such interest in cozying up\
      \ to Trump World. And his meeting with Republicans in Rocky River was far less\
      \ flashy than Hagan\u2019s evening with the Mooch. Speaking to about 30 local\
      \ activists gathered in a tiny room at the neighborhood library, Gonzalez hardly\
      \ mentioned Trump. Instead he mixed mild boilerplate \u2014 he nonchalantly\
      \ established himself as pro-gun and anti-abortion \u2014 with the story of\
      \ how his grandparents fled Cuba during Fidel Castro\u2019s uprising. Gonzalez,\
      \ whose father runs a Cleveland-area steel company, also mourned manufacturing\u2019\
      s decline. \u201CWhat we should all agree on,\u201D he said, \u201Cis that the\
      \ next 25 years are going to be a heck of a lot more disruptive than the previous\
      \ 25 years.\u201D His most direct reference to Trump came late in the hour,\
      \ when someone asked for his thoughts on immigration reform. \u201CI think the\
      \ president\u2019s proposal is spot on,\u201D he said, endorsing Trump\u2019\
      s push to complete a wall along the Mexican border. During an interview the\
      \ following week at a Panera, Gonzalez said he was \u201Cvery happy with the\
      \ result\u201D of the 2016 election. But he sighed audibly and paused for nearly\
      \ 10 seconds when asked why he thought Trump won. \u201CYou know, I think \u2026\
      \ that\u2019s a good question,\u201D he said finally. \u201CI think he gave\
      \ voice to something that had been largely ignored or had sat below the surface\
      \ for a while. You can call it the silent majority. I think that\u2019s a fine\
      \ term. But who was that? It was all of us who felt like one way or another\
      \ this country just stopped working for the everyday person.\u201D Hagan is\
      \ far less circumspect, not only when it comes to praise for Trump, but also\
      \ when it comes to policy. A guest at the Mooch fundraiser proudly told the\
      \ crowd how Hagan once received an AR-15 for Mother\u2019s Day. (Hagan has a\
      \ 2-year-old daughter and announced recently that she is pregnant with twins.\
      \ Gonzalez is expecting his first child in April.) The same style of gun had\
      \ been used a week earlier in the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\
      \ In the interview after the fundraiser, Hagan expressed deep skepticism about\
      \ gun control proposals now being debated in Washington and suggested using\
      \ local tax dollars \u201Cto ensure we have armed personnel on staff at every\
      \ school.\u201D Gonzalez said he has no personal problem with the AR-15, and\
      \ he backed into an answer on arming teachers and other school staff by calling\
      \ himself a \u201Cbig states\u2019 rights, kind of federalist guy\u201D who\
      \ would leave such decisions up to local school boards. Chris LaCivita, his\
      \ top political consultant, later intercepted a question about whether Gonzalez\
      \ owns a gun: \u201CThat\u2019s no one\u2019s damn business.\u201D\n\nHagan\
      \ also uses hotter rhetoric on immigration \u2014 and in one instance many are\
      \ convinced she also used Gonzalez\u2019s Hispanic last name as a dog whistle\
      \ to racist voters. In a Feb. 11 tweet, Hagan highlighted a Fox News segment\
      \ on undocumented immigrants and an Ohio heroin ring. She singled out only one\
      \ of the three suspects by name: Armando Gonzalez-Rosas \u2014 and left out\
      \ the \u201CRosas.\u201D The move drew a rare rebuke from Ohio Republican Party\
      \ Chair Jane Timken, who asked Hagan to delete the tweet. Hagan refused. She\
      \ also does not deny that she was calling attention to her opponent\u2019s ethnicity.\
      \ \u201CThis is a tough business,\u201D Hagan told BuzzFeed News. \u201CIf they\
      \ do not like the context of the tweet, which was entirely factual, that\u2019\
      s unfortunate, but it doesn\u2019t make it less factual.\u201D Nonetheless,\
      \ it has cost her. Republican leaders in Cuyahoga County, which accounts for\
      \ the largest chunk of GOP votes in the district, grumbled about the tweet last\
      \ month before the county party endorsed Gonzalez. And despite Hagan\u2019s\
      \ strong anti-abortion credentials, Ohio Right to Life, one of the state\u2019\
      s most influential conservative groups, backed Gonzalez after its president\
      \ criticized the tweet, according to cleveland.com. Some Republicans are sensitive\
      \ to questions about whether a candidate named Gonzalez can win in the Ohio\
      \ 16th, especially against a familiar ballot name like Hagan. \u201CWe have\
      \ had a dominant congressional delegation over the years, but other than Deb\
      \ Pryce and Jean Schmidt for a hot minute, it\u2019s been all white guys,\u201D\
      \ said Matt Borges, the former state party chair and a devout Ohio State fan\
      \ who was an early Gonzalez supporter. \u201CI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018\
      You\u2019re never gonna get a guy named Gonzalez through a primary in that district.\u2019\
      \u201D To Hagan, all of this is more fodder for her anti-establishment pitch.\
      \ For example, Timken officially is neutral. But her husband Tim, the CEO of\
      \ a major steel company in the Ohio 16th and one of the state\u2019s most generous\
      \ GOP donors, is behind Gonzalez \u2014 a relationship that Gonzalez\u2019s\
      \ family ties to the Northeast Ohio steel industry helped forge. \u201CIn a\
      \ way, it is an honor to not have that type of support,\u201D said Hagan, \u201C\
      but it never becomes \u2026 less frustrating or disappointing that you could\
      \ fight for a community for seven years and still see the door closed in your\
      \ face.\u201D Gonzalez, indeed, is commanding the money race. The latest campaign\
      \ finance reports showed him with $742,000 in cash on hand, plus a $40,000 personal\
      \ loan. (Manning, his former Indianapolis Colts teammate, is among the top donors.)\
      \ Hagan had $199,000. \u201CWe\u2019re the campaign, in my opinion, with the\
      \ energy, and the excitement, and the real base,\u201D Hagan said. \u201COur\
      \ opposition has a very stagnated type of support that\u2019s maybe correlated\
      \ more so to a football-type of environment. I\u2019ll never capture that, because\
      \ I\u2019m not a football player.\u201D Republican observers attribute Gonzalez\u2019\
      s fast start to strong first impressions. One activist recalled how Hagan bolted\
      \ early from a local party function, but Gonzalez hung around after it was over\
      \ to talk to everyone. And even before the results in Pennsylvania, many viewed\
      \ the Trump-cautious Gonzalez as more electable. \u201CAnthony made the case\
      \ over these last few months, by being present at every meeting, that he has\
      \ the passion and work ethic to get things done,\u201D said Rob Frost, the Cuyahoga\
      \ County GOP chair. \u201CAnd he made case at our meeting that he\u2019s best\
      \ candidate to win in November.\u201D But first, Republican voters in Ohio will\
      \ answer a question about what works best in 2018: running like Trump never\
      \ existed, or running just like him. \u25CF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\

    text: "Atlanta plans to bid to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention when\
      \ the DNC's request for proposal goes out this spring, the chair of the Georgia\
      \ Democratic Party told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\n\"We're actively looking forward\
      \ to making a bid for the 2020 Democratic National Convention,\" said DuBose\
      \ Porter, the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party.\n\nPorter said that he,\
      \ along with Nikema Williams, the first vice chair of the party, and Dan Halpern,\
      \ the DNC's deputy national finance chair, met in Atlanta with Mayor Keisha\
      \ Lance Bottoms just before the DNC's spring meeting to discuss the topic of\
      \ bringing the convention to Atlanta. Bottoms, he said, was 100% behind the\
      \ effort and wants to partner in the effort.\n\n\"We have the facilities, we\
      \ have the infrastructure, and we feel like we can get the resources,\" Porter\
      \ said. When the request for proposals goes out, he said, Atlanta will meet\
      \ logistical requirements, such as airport capacity and adequate hotel accommodations.\n\
      \nPrivately, national Democrats who spoke with BuzzFeed News this week expressed\
      \ excitement that Atlanta \u2014 in a state that Democrats eventually hope to\
      \ turn blue \u2014 would be in the running with other cities. (Milwaukee, for\
      \ instance, has announced that it will bid; Wisconsin is one of the key Midwestern\
      \ states that Democrats hope to win again after Hillary Clinton's loss there\
      \ in 2016.)\n\n\"Atlanta tells a better story,\" said Porter, explaining the\
      \ city's advantage over other cities. He noted Atlanta's status as the cradle\
      \ of the civil rights movement, and it is home to Rep. John Lewis, an icon in\
      \ the fight for access to equal justice. \"The history of Atlanta tells a story\
      \ about the Democratic Party\" that would make the convention meaningful, he\
      \ said.\n\nPorter said the timing of the convention could coincide with Georgia\
      \ turning blue, a point of concern for Democrats focused on shifting demographics\
      \ around the country. He said statewide races are winnable, but asked about\
      \ Georgia's heated Democratic governor's primary \u2014 between Stacey Evans\
      \ and Stacey Abrams \u2014 Porter said the party had a pair of great candidates,\
      \ but that his job \"is to bring everybody together after it's over.\""

    text: "California Sen. Kamala Harris is expected to endorse Ben Jealous in Maryland's\
      \ Democratic primary for governor, two sources familiar with the development\
      \ tell BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe endorsement would lend Jealous, the former president\
      \ and CEO of the NAACP, another boost in a tough primary. Jealous is clawing\
      \ to pick up traction against Rushern L. Baker III, the well-liked Prince George's\
      \ County executive leading in many of the polls. Baltimore County Executive\
      \ Kevin Kamenetz is also polling among the top Democrats candidates are fighting\
      \ for the chance to take on Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nSaying he wanted\
      \ Barack Obama to name a black woman to the Supreme Court, Jealous told Politico\
      \ in 2013 that Harris would be a \"brilliant pick,\" saying, \"I personally\
      \ would like to see somebody young who could stay on there for decades,\" he\
      \ said.\n\nJealous campaign spokesperson Kevin Harris told BuzzFeed News that\
      \ the pair have a \"really good relationship,\" but declined to confirm an endorsement\
      \ \u2014 or a planned event \u2014 was coming. \"They have known each other\
      \ for years,\" said Kevin Harris, \"and the candidate admires and respects her.\"\
      \n\nA spokesperson for Kamala Harris did not respond to a request for comment\
      \ Thursday evening.\n\nThree other potential contenders for the 2020 Democratic\
      \ presidential nomination have endorsed Jealous, 45, in Maryland. Bernie Sanders,\
      \ appearing with Jealous at a raucous rally last summer, exclaimed, \"It sounds\
      \ like Maryland is ready for a political revolution!\" Jealous has picked up\
      \ the endorsements of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Los Angeles Mayor Eric\
      \ Garcetti.\n\n\n\nHarris has also endorsed a number of prominent black candidates\
      \ over the last year, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Virginia\
      \ Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax.\n\nAnd Harris's support may be particularly notable\
      \ for black Marylanders, who make up nearly a third of the state's voters. As\
      \ those Democrats \u2014 national black Democrats at large \u2014 look forward\
      \ to a possible Harris candidacy, she has also made some efforts to endear herself\
      \ to the progressive wing of the party, which has offered critiques of her record\
      \ as attorney general of California. Harris was the first Democrat to sign on\
      \ to Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill last August."

    text: "Politics and tech have long occupied uneasy, parallel worlds. Politicians\
      \ are painfully clueless about the basics of technology; technologists are,\
      \ as we are seeing, painfully naive about politics. Companies born in the '00s\
      \ and that grew up in the '10s were, until recently, often under the blissful\
      \ impression that what happened in politics didn\u2019t much matter as long\
      \ as regulators stayed away. That\u2019s changed.\n\nOne of the first big-league\
      \ political operatives to cross that divide was Mark Penn. He went to work for\
      \ Microsoft during the last great confrontation of government and tech: the\
      \ 1990s antitrust battle. He was Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 strategist and\
      \ after that defeat \u2014 he returned to Microsoft full time, and brought with\
      \ him all the aggression he\u2019d been talked out of directing at Barack Obama:\
      \ From 2012 to 2014, he ran the company\u2019s marketing and directed a political\
      \ assault on their core rival, Google, under the characteristically subtle moniker\
      \ \u201CScroogled.\u201D\n\n\u201CThey read your mail!\u201D he still points\
      \ out.\n\nToday the crisis of tech and politics has hit a new peak for Google,\
      \ Twitter, and \u2014 especially \u2014 Facebook, and so I asked Penn what he\u2019\
      d advise the embattled and largely silent social media giant do.\n\nFirst, he\
      \ said, it\u2019s not clear what Facebook actually stands for.\n\n\u201CI think\
      \ it's a problem kind of like Microsoft had,\u201D he said. \u201CI don't think\
      \ it fundamentally undermines their platform \u2014 but it's a very, very serious\
      \ hit for their image. Their company is built on openness and authenticity.\
      \ If they believe in openness they better defend it. And if they believe in\
      \ authenticity I think the better they better make sure their accounts are real.\u201D\
      \n\nBut he also suggested a deeper problem: a company so totally identified\
      \ with its founder that the two rise or fall together.\n\n\u201CThe Facebook\
      \ image is driven largely by both Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl [Sandberg],\u201D\
      \ he said. \u201CMicrosoft is not uniquely identified with Bill Gates.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CPart of what they need is to create a long-lasting image of the company\
      \ built on principles that they articulate and they execute,\u201D he said.\n\
      \nPenn is now fully in the private sector, running the Stagwell Group, a holding\
      \ company for, among others, digital political operations that\u2019s funded\
      \ by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\n(In that capacity, he heard a pitch\
      \ last year from a firm that boasted its crucial role in Trump\u2019s election.\
      \ The company was Cambridge Analytica. \u201CIt was really weird,\u201D he recalled.\
      \ \u201DWhat they had to say just didn\u2019t make sense.\u201D)\n\nPenn had\
      \ come up to New York to sell his new book, Microtrends Squared, and we spoke\
      \ over breakfast under what he described as the \u201CBob Woodward rules \u2014\
      \ it\u2019s off the record as long as it\u2019s not very interesting.\u201D\n\
      \nIn his new book, he adds depth and a darker tone to his 2007 book, Microtrends.\
      \ Then, he advanced a cheery vision of a society happily splintered by infinite\
      \ choice into a kaleidoscope of subgroups; the new vision is less cheerful,\
      \ but similarly paints a society best influenced through groups like Bikers\
      \ to Work, Pro-Proteiners, and Second-Fiddle Husbands.\n\n\u201CWe expected\
      \ that the advances in our ability to customize goods and services would open\
      \ us all up to a new world of never-ending experimentation,\u201D he writes.\
      \ \u201CA decade later, exactly the opposite has occurred, and our society has\
      \ become increasingly polarized, with people finding the choices they like and\
      \ picking them over and over again.\u201D\n\nSome of those choices have come\
      \ in the information economy, and Penn offered a prescription to get Facebook\
      \ out of that business.\n\n\u201CFacebook never should've gotten into news \u2014\
      \ that was a huge mistake,\u201D he said. \u201CThe only way out of it,\u201D\
      \ he said, is to treat the platform as the federal government does the airwaves.\
      \ \u201CAuction off 10 channels, agree to promote 10 channels equally, let people\
      \ choose, and get out of the news publishing and sorting business.\u201D\n\n\
      In the short term, though, Facebook is more or less scroogled, \u201Ctrying\
      \ to row against the narrative that \u2014 whether it\u2019s true or not \u2014\
      \ is almost impossible to row against.\u201D"

      \ after the US Supreme Court declined a request to halt the maps \u2014 issued\
      \ by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court earlier this year \u2014 from going into\
      \ effect.\n\nThe Monday afternoon order from the US Supreme Court, with no opinion\
      \ and no noted dissents, followed a more extensive ruling earlier Monday from\
      \ a three-judge district court panel reaching a similar conclusion. The pair\
      \ of rulings appeared \u2014 absent an unexpected development \u2014 to end\
      \ Republicans' hopes of stopping the maps from taking effect for the 2018 midterms.\n\
      \nUnder the map that was tossed out earlier this year by the Pennsylvania Supreme\
      \ Court, only five of the state's 18 congressional districts are represented\
      \ by Democrats \u2014 despite the fact that registered Democrats outnumber Republicans\
      \ in the swing state. The new map is expected to bring that number closer to\
      \ the parity that would be expected in the state.\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme\
      \ Court issued the new map itself in mid-February after the Republican-led state\
      \ legislature and Democratic governor could not agree on a new congressional\
      \ map. The redrawing process followed an order from the state's high court that\
      \ the state's earlier map was a partisan gerrymander that violated the state's\
      \ constitution.\n\nBecause the ruling was based on the state's constitution\
      \ and not the US Constitution, the options for opponents to challenge it were\
      \ limited. Pennsylvania Republicans tried to get federal courts to halt the\
      \ new map from going into effect by claiming that the state supreme court's\
      \ ruling violated the US Constitution's \"elections clause,\" which states that\
      \ \"[t]he Times, Places and Manner of\n\nholding Elections for Senators and\
      \ Representatives\" are to be set \"in each State by the Legislature thereof.\"\
      \n\nWith Monday's rulings, however, it appeared that the effort was unsuccessful\
      \ and that the new map would control the 2018 elections \u2014 furthering Democratic\
      \ hopes of retaking the House this fall."

      s fundraising in an interview on Thursday, saying his campaign disclosures contained\
      \ a large number of people from his home state of Indiana and \u201Ca huge amount\
      \ of the name Patel.\u201D\n\nAhead of this summer\u2019s New York primary,\
      \ Patel \u2014 a young businessperson running as a progressive \u2014 has so\
      \ far out-raised Maloney, the longtime incumbent in a New York City district\
      \ that has been redrawn in recent years to include trendier parts of Brooklyn.\
      \ He announced last month that he had raised more than $550,000.\n\n\u201CWell,\
      \ it\u2019s mainly from Indiana, where he\u2019s from,\u201D said Maloney when\
      \ asked about Patel\u2019s fundraising success. She added, \u201Cmainly a huge\
      \ amount of the name Patel, which is his name.\u201D\n\nMaloney\u2019s campaign\
      \ has made an issue of Patel\u2019s being from Indiana and raising money from\
      \ outside New York. He serves as the president of the Indianapolis-based SUN\
      \ Group, which acquires and develops hotels in the United States and is owned\
      \ by his family. Last month, his campaign told Politico that four immediate\
      \ family members and 10 other family members have donated to his campaign. (\u201C\
      He cannot depend on his wealthy Indiana family indefinitely and he will need\
      \ a lot more than that to create an identity, record, and reputation to sway\
      \ the people,\u201D a Maloney spokesperson told Politico. \u201CNo one knows\
      \ him and everyone knows Carolyn\u2019s record for fighting for the district.\u201D\
      )\n\nAsked what Maloney meant by the remark, on Saturday, Maloney spokesperson\
      \ George Arzt told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Patel is \u201Cpretending\
      \ like he's running a local grassroots campaign, but the truth is only 1.3%\
      \ of the half-million dollars he's raised comes from the district.\u201D\n\n\
      Maloney made the fundraising comments in an interview about a range of topics,\
      \ including the launch of a commemorative coin by the US Mint to increase breast\
      \ cancer research. The last two times Maloney has been challenged by a Democrat,\
      \ she\u2019s won by more than 50 points. \u201CI\u2019ve been to a lot of events\
      \ where I\u2019ve gotten continuous support from people I [either] actually\
      \ represented or worked on their problems or tried to help in some way,\u201D\
      \ said Maloney.\n\nPatel, 34, worked on both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential\
      \ campaigns as an advance staffer and currently lectures on business at New\
      \ York University.\n\nAsked about Maloney\u2019s comments about his fundraising,\
      \ Patel responded sharply, saying he wanted Maloney to know that not all people\
      \ with the last name Patel are related.\n\n\u201CI guess I didn\u2019t realize\
      \ Rep. Maloney hired Steve Bannon as her campaign strategist,\u201D he said.\n\
      \nPatel said he welcomes a debate on campaign contributors, mentioning that\
      \ Donald Trump has previously donated to Maloney. (The donations were made prior\
      \ to 2010; Trump infamously also gave to the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, and other\
      \ Democrats during that general period.) \u201CLet\u2019s let New York decide\
      \ whether it\u2019s more offensive to raise money from Patels and real people\
      \ like I do or from corporate PACs and Donald Trump like she does,\u201D he\
      \ said.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m a proud first-generation Indian-American,\u201D he\

    text: 'Andrew McCabe, the fired former deputy director of the FBI, kept personal
      memos detailing his interactions with President Donald Trump, as well as what
      happened during the time period when the president fired former FBI director
      James Comey, a source familiar with the situation told BuzzFeed News.


      McCabe no longer has the memos, the source noted, detailing that they are the
      same kind of memos that were kept by Comey.


      Both CNN and the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that special counsel
      Robert Mueller had the memos. A spokesperson for the Special Counsel''s Office
      declined to comment on the issue, and a Justice Department spokesperson told
      BuzzFeed News that she did not know whether Mueller''s office had the memos.


      The Associated Press first reported the existence of the McCabe memos on Saturday
      afternoon, following Attorney General Jeff Sessions decision on Friday night
      to fire McCabe due what he wrote was an "unauthorized disclosure" to the media
      and a lack of candor with investigators.


      Shortly after the AP broke the news of the memos, Trump continued his attacks
      on Comey, McCabe, and the broader government he has now run for nearly 14 months,
      lashing out about "tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels
      of the FBI, Justice & State" and, specifically, about the response of the "Fake
      News" to McCabe being "caught, called out and fired."'

    text: "The news arrived without warning, on Thursday at 2 p.m., in a tweet: \u201C\
      Today, I am calling on Gavin Newsom to step down from his position as lieutenant\
      \ governor.\u201D\n\n\n\nOver the next 15 minutes, a 21-point thread unfolded\
      \ on Twitter, citing the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment statistics, and\
      \ a list of politicians recently stripped from power \u2014 before making the\
      \ case that Newsom, the leading Democrat in the California governor\u2019s race,\
      \ has exhibited \u201Ca pattern of misusing his power in the workplace,\u201D\
      \ based on publicly reported details about two relationships from more than\
      \ a decade ago.\n\n\u201CIt is time for violators in the workplace to step down.\
      \ Or be forced out.\u201D\n\nThe warning from Amanda Renteria, a 43-year-old\
      \ Democratic operative who entered the governor\u2019s race last month, left\
      \ California political circles bewildered and transfixed \u2014 an unexpected\
      \ and contentious turn in one of 2018\u2019s biggest races, pitting rival Democrats\
      \ against one another in the complicated political arena of the #MeToo movement.\n\
      \nRenteria\u2019s case against Newsom drew on the experiences of two women in\
      \ 2005 and 2006. Newsom\u2019s camp has since responded in blunt terms, accusing\
      \ Renteria of exploiting the #MeToo phenomenon for political gain. The effort\
      \ is one they describe as a \u201Cself-serving political stunt\u201D that \u201C\
      cheapens\u201D and \u201Cdegrades\u201D the movement.\n\nAlmost overnight, amid\
      \ tense Democratic primaries across California, the Renteria incident has turned\
      \ the state\u2019s gubernatorial race into a staging ground for complex questions\
      \ about how candidates talk about the #MeToo movement and tell the stories of\
      \ other women, when their campaigns may stand to benefit.\n\nRenteria, a former\
      \ congressional candidate who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s national political\
      \ director in 2016, joined the crowded California governor\u2019s race last\
      \ month. Her decision to run statewide \u2014 after just one failed congressional\
      \ bid, in a field with nationally known candidates like Gavin Newsom and Antonio\
      \ Villaraigosa, and just days before the party\u2019s state convention \u2014\
      \ came as a shock to friends and former colleagues. Her campaign, a small operation\
      \ based in Menlo Park, has remained quiet for much of the last month. Up until\
      \ this week, a good number of Democrats believed she could be a plant for Newsom,\
      \ to siphon off votes from Villaraigosa.\n\nThat theory fell apart when the\
      \ Renteria for Governor campaign unveiled its new offensive. \u201CI'm totally\
      \ fired up,\u201D said Renteria said afterward. \u201CThese are the kind of\
      \ conversations that change the future. We've got to call out character for\
      \ what it is.\u201D\n\nSince Thursday, however, no prominent Democrats have\
      \ voiced support for the Newsom push. In California, other campaigns steered\
      \ clear of the story. And in Newsom\u2019s camp, aides and supporters came forward\
      \ to openly question Renteria\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201CThis kind of brazen\
      \ and self-serving political stunt doesn\u2019t even deserve a response,\u201D\
      \ said Nathan Click, Newsom\u2019s communications director.\n\nWomen in the\
      \ state who support Newsom also offered biting criticism for Renteria\u2019\
      s resignation effort. \u201CEven by campaign standards,\u201D said State Sen.\
      \ Toni Atkins, incoming leader of the California Senate, \u201Cit\u2019s a preposterous\
      \ suggestion that unfortunately distracts from the real importance and urgency\
      \ of the #MeToo movement.\u201D\n\nBuffy Wicks, a longtime Newsom supporter\
      \ now running in a crowded race for state assembly, said, \u201C#MeToo is a\
      \ critical movement for women\u2019s equality. Transparent efforts to use this\
      \ for political gain cheapen and do a disservice to this movement.\u201D\n\n\
      As Renteria sees it, she\u2019s raising legitimate questions about \u201Cjudgment\u201D\
      \ and \u201Ccharacter.\u201D\n\nHer case against Newsom details two relationships\
      \ from his time as mayor of San Francisco: a 2005 affair with his former staffer,\
      \ Ruby Rippey Gibney, married at the time to Newsom\u2019s friend and campaign\
      \ manager; and a 2006 relationship, at age 38, with a 19-year-old model, Brittanie\
      \ Mountz, who once made local headlines when photographers saw her with a glass\
      \ of wine at a gala that Newsom also attended.\n\nRenteria said she did not\
      \ attempt to contact Rippey Gibney or Mountz.\n\nMultiple California Democrats\
      \ raised concerns about any political effort making reference to women and their\
      \ experiences without first consulting with them.\n\n\u201C#MeToo is about ownership\
      \ of our experiences because we all have stories that are ours alone to tell,\u201D\
      \ said Shawnda Westly, the California Democratic Party\u2019s former executive\
      \ director. \u201CInstead, Amanda has chosen to degrade the movement for her\
      \ own political purposes by manipulating someone else\u2019s story for her gain.\u201D\
      \n\nAs she\u2019s made her push for Newsom\u2019s resignation, Renteria has\
      \ cited details from both of these relationships \u2014 while also invoking\
      \ the #MeToo movement and working to depict a \u201Cpattern\u201D of workplace\
      \ misconduct or misuse of power in the workplace.\n\n\u201CI tried my best to\
      \ not actually make it about the individuals,\u201D she said.\n\nRenteria noted\
      \ that her tweets do not mention Rippey Gibney or Mountz by name. (The tweets\
      \ do include links to news articles that refer to both women by name, however.)\n\
      \n\u201CI guess maybe I\u2019m curious as to why people think we shouldn't talk\
      \ about the underage drinking stuff, that we shouldn't be talking about what\
      \ kind of workplace people set, that we shouldn't be talking about setting a\
      \ higher bar in general in the place,\u201D she said.\n\nLast month, in a Facebook\
      \ post expressing support for the #MeToo movement, Rippey Gibney said she is\
      \ \u201Cdoubtful\u201D that her relationship with Newsom applies. \u201CYes,\
      \ I was a subordinate,\u201D she wrote, \u201Cbut I was also a free-thinking,\
      \ 33-[year]-old adult, married woman, and mother.\u201D\n\nRippey Gibney and\
      \ Mountz did not return requests for comment.\n\nNewsom has also addressed the\
      \ #MeToo movement, apologizing again for the 2005 affair at a Politico forum\
      \ last month. \u201CI would say the same thing that I said [then] to the voters\
      \ in San Francisco. That I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I learned an\
      \ enormous amount from it,\u201D Newsom said. \u201CI am every day trying to\
      \ be a champion and a model, not just for women and girls, but to deal with\
      \ the issue that we need to focus on, which is the crisis with men and boys\
      \ in this state and in this country.\u201D\n\nThe topic of \u201Cmarital infidelities\u201D\
      \ came up last month at a Republican primary debate, when GOP candidates argued\
      \ that legitimate questions of \u201Cmoral character\u201D surrounded both Newsom\
      \ and Villaraigosa. (Villaraigosa, the other leading Democrat in the race, had\
      \ an affair with a TV reporter while he served as Los Angeles mayor.)\n\nRenteria\
      \ is the first Democrat gubernatorial candidate to bring up the issue.\n\n\u201C\
      It\u2019s actually surprising to me that it hasn\u2019t been raised,\u201D she\
      \ said."

    text: "Stacey Abrams' campaign for governor this week issued a \"time-sensitive\"\
      \ push to pick up endorsements of black lawmakers as the campaign weathered\
      \ one of its tougher weeks.\n\nReports surfaced detailing Abrams' personal finances\
      \ and business affairs, and BuzzFeed News reported Tuesday that an endorsement\
      \ by Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta's popular new mayor, was imminent and widely\
      \ believed to be for her opponent.\n\nThe email was sent by Abrams' deputy campaign\
      \ manager, Chris Smith, and was reportedly sent to top aides of the Congressional\
      \ Black Caucus on Tuesday, two people briefed on the matter said.\n\nAbrams\
      \ wanted to \"make sure you all know that we appreciate all of the help and\
      \ the support\u201D of the campaign, adding she was writing to \"see if your\
      \ member is willing to publicly endorse Minority Leader Stacey Abrams for Governor\
      \ of Georgia and willing to let the campaign use their name as a public endorser?\"\
      \ The note also mentioned that Abrams was eager to hit the campaign trail with\
      \ members of Congress.\n\nAbrams is vying to make history by becoming the first\
      \ black woman to win her state's Democratic nomination for governor. If successful,\
      \ she would also become the first black woman to be governor in US history.\
      \ Her opponent, Georgia-born Stacey Evans, an attorney and former fellow legislator,\
      \ has the support of much of the state's Democratic establishment. Abrams enjoys\
      \ support from the likes of Our Revolution Georgia and EMILY's List, looking\
      \ to reverse a spate of Democratic statewide losses by expanding the electorate\
      \ to include more infrequent, hard-to-reach voters.\n\nIt's not clear if this\
      \ week's effort was a success, but Abrams has previously been a fixture in Washington\
      \ and is already backed by Reps. Marcia Fudge, Barbara Lee, David Scott, and\
      \ Hank Johnson. Rep. John Lewis endorsed Abrams last July, calling her candidacy\
      \ \"a model for our nation.\"\n\nIn a statement Friday night, LaDavia Drane,\
      \ senior aide to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, said there was an endorsement\
      \ effort underway for Abrams. \"Members of the CBC have been excited about Stacey\
      \ Abrams since the launch of her campaign and have been working with her in\
      \ various ways for months,\u201D she said, \u201Cincluding for an endorsement\
      \ rollout.\"\n\n\"We're grateful for the growing support for this campaign,\"\
      \ Abrams spokesperson Priyanka Mantha said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.\
      \ \u201CSince the beginning, we've been reaching out to Georgians to hear about\

      \ in the race who both understands their struggles first-hand, and has a bold\
      \ vision and real plans to find solutions that will help families thrive.\"\n\
      \nThis week, amid the appeal for support from Washington, reports surfaced that\
      \ Abrams owed more than $50,000 to the IRS, and almost $170,000 more in student\
      \ loan and credit card debt.\n\nShe detailed some of her personal problems in\
      \ a Medium post last month, saying that her lack of financial literacy led her\
      \ to make poor decisions with credit cards as a college student. Later, after\
      \ Hurricane Katrina hit her family's community, she said she had \u201Crearranged\
      \ my financial life and stretched every penny I had.\u201D\n\n\n\nOn Medium,\
      \ Abrams said she was proposing policies to protect economically vulnerable\
      \ Georgians. \u201CFor my family, for me, and for countless others across Georgia\
      \ today, it\u2019s not simply lack of access to economic mobility, it\u2019\
      s that we are rarely taught the tools to help us get there. Instead, we fumble\
      \ our way through, making mistakes that haunt us, sometimes grappling with shame\

      \ came out of the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into\

      \ email server while secretary of state. Communications from the inspector general\u2019\
      s office regarding McCabe's candor to investigators about a news report involving\

      \ the Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired, White House press\
      \ secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision was up to Sessions \u2014\

      \ that spanned three decades at the FBI. McCabe joined the FBI in 1996, as a\
      \ special agent assigned to the New York Field Office. A decade later, McCabe\

      \ was over before McCabe was promoted to deputy director. At the time of his\
      \ wife's campaign, McCabe had no oversight of any Clinton investigation and\
      \ recused himself from investigations relating to Virginia politics. After McCabe\

    text: "President Donald Trump has joined the legal fight over whether a woman\
      \ is bound by an agreement she signed in 2016 to keep quiet about their alleged\
      \ affair.\n\nStephanie Clifford, the adult film performer and director known\
      \ as Stormy Daniels, sued Trump and the company set up by longtime Trump lawyer\
      \ Michael Cohen in 2016 to pay Clifford to keep quiet.\n\n\n\nLawyers for that\
      \ company, Essential Consultants (EC), filed a notice Friday afternoon in California\
      \ to remove her case from state court to federal court and asserted that, under\
      \ the 2016 agreement, they could seek damages of at least $20 million.\n\n\n\
      \nCharles Harder, an attorney best known for representing Hulk Hogan in his\
      \ legal fight against Gawker, filed a notice on behalf of Trump joining in the\
      \ removal. \"Mr. Trump intends to join in EC\u2019s anticipated Petition to\
      \ Compel Arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement,\" he announced.\n\nIn\
      \ Clifford's lawsuit, her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, claims that the settlement\
      \ agreement and therefore its confidentiality provisions \u2014 which they call\
      \ a \"hush agreement\" \u2014 were never valid because Trump did not sign the\
      \ agreement. He also argues that the agreement should be found to be invalid\
      \ as counter to public policy.\n\n\n\n\"This is simply more of the same bullying\
      \ tactics from the president and Mr. Cohen. They are now attempting to remove\
      \ this case in order to increase their chances that the matter will ultimately\
      \ be decided in private arbitration, behind closed doors, outside of public\
      \ view and scrutiny,\" Avenatti told BuzzFeed News. \"To put it simply \u2014\
      \ they want to hide the truth from the American people. We will oppose this\
      \ effort at every turn.\"\n\n\n\nIn its removal notice, EC makes clear it will\
      \ defend the validity of the agreement and its requirement that any dispute\
      \ be settled by arbitration.\n\n\"EC is aware of at least twenty (20) violations\
      \ by Clifford of the confidentiality provisions of the Settlement Agreement,\"\
      \ Brent Blakely, the lawyer for EC, wrote. Due to a provision in the agreement\
      \ that each breach of the confidentiality provisions could lead to $1 million\
      \ in damages, Blakely argues that \"EC and/or Defendant Trump have the right\
      \ to seek liquidated damages against Clifford for her numerous breaches\" in\
      \ the arbitration for an amount \"approximated to already be in excess of twenty\
      \ million dollars ($20,000,000).\"\n\nRegarding that claim, Avenatti told BuzzFeed\
      \ News, \"The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20 million in\
      \ bogus 'damages' against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the\
      \ public what really happened, is truly remarkable. Likely unprecedented in\
      \ our history. We are not going away and we will not be intimidated by these\
      \ threats.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Clifford sat down with Anderson Cooper for\
      \ an interview, which 60 Minutes plans to air later this month.\n\n\n\nLawyers\
      \ for Trump and EC did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the\
      \ filings and Avenatti's comments Friday evening."

    text: "Millions of Americans routinely receive desperate emails from campaigns,\
      \ perpetually on the edge of catastrophe and asking for just one more dollar\
      \ to help bring the campaign back from complete ruin before an ominous midnight\
      \ fundraising deadline.\n\nAnd nobody does it like the Democratic Congressional\
      \ Campaign Committee, the true artists of the dire email fundraiser.\n\n\u201C\
      If we let Trump and his Republicans bury us, our chance of winning this election\
      \ is absolutely gone. Will you help us close the gap before midnight?\u201D\
      \ the DCCC pleaded in an email titled \"URGENT\" before the presidential election.\n\
      \nIncreasingly, though, Democratic strategists argue that there is a cost to\
      \ the \u201Cchurn-and-burn\u201D fundraising strategy that outweighs the extra\
      \ dollars it brings in. The cost of the spammy, fear-based communications, they\
      \ say, is depressed and alienated voters and the public impression of the Democratic\
      \ Party as just another arm of a cynical, dishonest establishment.\n\n\u201C\
      Constantly screaming about doom, we\u2019re going to lose \u2014 it may raise\
      \ money for them. Clearly they do it because it raises money for them,\u201D\
      \ said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of Daily Kos, \u201Cbut it does not create\
      \ an environment where Democrats are eager to fight and win, because nobody\
      \ wants to fight for a team they know is going to lose.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe approach\
      \ they\u2019ve used with alarmist language in their fundraising emails has become\
      \ pervasive,\u201D said Matthew McGregor, a former Democratic digital strategist,\
      \ who worked for the Obama campaign. \u201CWhat does this say about us about\
      \ our values and how we value our supporters?\u201D\n\nFor voters who probably\
      \ don\u2019t often interact with the national party, the strategy can be disorienting.\
      \ In the days leading up to to Pennsylvania\u2019s special election, for instance,\
      \ the DCCC piled on an array of mixed messages on the state of the race:\n\n\
      \u201CConor Lamb DEFEATED?!\u201D\n\n\u201CConor Lamb WINS?!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
      Gut-wrenching loss\u201D\n\n\u201CCONOR. LAMB. WINS!!!\u201D\n\nFundraising\
      \ has massively changed during the last several presidential cycles, especially\
      \ in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns\u2019 success in raising money\
      \ through small-dollar email blasts. Over the last five years, especially, the\
      \ national party committees \u2014 everyone from the Republican National Committee\
      \ to the DCCC \u2014 have emphasized a never-ending series of impending monthly\
      \ or quarterly fundraising deadlines.\n\nThat\u2019s long frustrated some Democrats,\
      \ but especially now, when anti-Trump fervor has fueled new candidates in newly\
      \ competitive districts, and when many Democrats have become reenergized around\
      \ a variety of issues, from gun control to representation for people of color\
      \ and women.\n\n\u201CI think the DCCC\u2019s email strategy is a wasted opportunity\
      \ for Democrats. They have this expansive email list that they could be using\
      \ to cultivate and motivate voters to flip congressional seats in 2018,\u201D\
      \ said Laura Olin, a Democratic digital strategist who\u2019s worked with a\
      \ host of progressives including Barack Obama\u2019s digital team.\n\n\u201C\
      The thing is that fundraising campaigns from Obama, Warren, and Bernie showed\
      \ us that we don\u2019t need to use those scare tactics to raise money, and\
      \ those tactics don\u2019t make us lose our values by being inclusive, engaging,\
      \ and honest rather than being alarmist and misleading,\u201D said McGregor.\n\
      \nThe current energy has helped drive a number of online-based national efforts\
      \ outside of the traditional party apparatus, like Swing Left (which raises\
      \ money for Democratic nominees) or any number of massively viral fundraising\
      \ drives for nominees in special elections.\n\nParty committees have a wider\
      \ set of spending demands, and no one can say the strategy hasn\u2019t been\
      \ effective in pure fundraising terms. Just last week the DCCC said they had\
      \ raised more than $50 million online. \u201CSmall dollar, grassroots donations\
      \ have propelled the DCCC to record-breaking online fundraising this cycle.\
      \ It\u2019s clear that the base of our party is unified around the goal of taking\
      \ back the House,\u201D said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law.\n\nThat, people agree\
      \ on.\n\n\u201CDoes it raise a bunch of money for candidates? Hell yeah, [Jon]\
      \ Ossoff raised a shit ton of money. But at what cost?\u201D asked one operative.\
      \ \u201CIt\u2019s run in the model of the DCCC created back in 2013 and its\
      \ exhausting our voters. There\u2019s not an infinite pool of people to pull\
      \ from and their strategy is going to turn people off from supporting Democratic\
      \ causes.\u201D\n\nBut party strategists want to see the DCCC treat Democratic\
      \ voters like \u201Cactual adults\u201D who don\u2019t need to be tricked into\
      \ supporting the party with misleading headlines.\n\n\u201CThey have this relentless\
      \ fucking strategy that seems to overwhelm and deceive their supporters,\u201D\
      \ one former Democratic digital strategist told BuzzFeed News. \u201CThe desperation\
      \ and outright lies placed in these emails are going to be bad for the party.\
      \ The DCCC is so prevalent that it sets itself up as the de facto face of the\
      \ party by the sheer force and volume [of its emails] that can\u2019t be distinguished\
      \ from the rest of the party.\u201D"

      \n\n\nIn response, Manigault-Newman said the reason that Heritage\u2019s Kay\
      \ Coles James wasn\u2019t offered a position in the administration is \u201C\
      because she hates Donald Trump.\u201D\n\nJames, the first black president at\
      \ the conservative think tank, told Politico on Wednesday that Manigault-Newman\
      \ had treated her role in Trump\u2019s universe like it was The Apprentice.\
      \ \u201CSo she looked around Washington and said, 'OK, who do I need to get\
      \ rid of first?'\u201D James said.\n\nManigault-Newman insisted that's not the\
      \ case, saying James, a veteran political operative, who was director of the\
      \ Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush, was flagged early in\
      \ the transition process as a \"Never Trump\" Republican who was known to be\
      \ \"disgusted\" by the president.\n\nManigault-Newman said she was taken aback\
      \ by James\u2019 comments. \u201CWhen I met with her, she was very explicit\
      \ that she hated Trump, but she loved the Republican Party's agenda,\" she said,\
      \ adding that James told her she was open to working with the administration\
      \ but that she would have to \"hold her nose while doing it\u201D with Trump\
      \ as the leader of the party.\n\n\"Kay Cole James is trying to scapegoat me\
      \ instead of dealing with the fact that Reince [Priebus] and the rest of the\
      \ transition team did not want her within a mile of the White House,\" said\
      \ Manigault-Newman.\n\nJames did not immediately respond to a message seeking\
      \ comment Thursday.\n\nManigault-Newman, who was recently a contestant on Celebrity\
      \ Big Brother, in which she threw several barbs about White House dysfunction,\
      \ including a bit about her former boss\u2019s use of Twitter, also characterized\
      \ James' use of The Apprentice to make her point about as \u201Cinsulting\u201D\
      \ to Trump.\n\n\"By insulting The Apprentice, she is essentially insulting President\
      \ Trump,\" she said. \"The Apprentice was his brainchild. He was the star of\
      \ the show and was very proud of it. Utilizing the show in that way is not only\
      \ an insult to the president, but she is continuing to show her hand as a Never\
      \ Trump Republican by trying to trivialize its success.\u201D\n\nJames supported\
      \ Jeb Bush in the primary. As late as May 2016, James was part of a group of\
      \ prominent black conservative activists who were strategizing ways to work\
      \ with Trump, even as they remained highly skeptical of his style of campaigning\
      \ and prospects for winning.\n\nBlack conservatives\u2019 agenda remains sharply\
      \ focused on issues like expanding economic opportunity, especially increasing\
      \ access to capital for small businesses. Many have also sought to work with\
      \ principals like Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul on big projects like a criminal\
      \ justice overhaul. In Trump, James told Politico she saw a potential ally.\n\
      \n\u201CIf he was serious about getting those things done \u2014 and I believed\
      \ him to be, and I still do believe that he is \u2014 then I saw an opportunity\
      \ to do things that perhaps hadn\u2019t existed in a Republican administration\
      \ before,\u201D said James, according to Politico. \u201CI was very looking\
      \ forward to an opportunity to serve in that White House in some capacity to\
      \ help maybe on domestic policy, maybe in the Office of Public Liaison \u2014\
      \ in any of those capacities to get the job done.\u201D\n\nIn a profile of Manigault-Newman\
      \ last year, BuzzFeed News reported in detail on her role in Trump\u2019s orbit.\
      \ Some of her portfolio seemed informal in nature, such as spearheading the\
      \ administration\u2019s efforts focused on black Americans \u2014 or keeping\
      \ senior official abreast of operatives who had not been sufficiently loyal\
      \ to Trump during the campaign at bay.\n\nAccording to Manigault-Newman, James\
      \ lobbied Priebus for a period of time after the election to appoint her to\
      \ a high-profile position in the White House. James joined Trump\u2019s transition\
      \ team, which was all but forced to hire experienced hands, regardless of whether\
      \ they had been loyal to Trump.\n\nThe question is not if she blocked James\
      \ from an appointment, Manigault-Newman said, but \u201Cwhy her appointment\
      \ wasn\u2019t made by Reince.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy wasn\u2019t she appointed like\
      \ everybody else? Did she help on the campaign, or with any events? Did she\
      \ do any outreach or engagement? How much money did she raise for the campaign?\n\
      \nRegardless of her status inside the White House, James\u2019 appointment to\
      \ Heritage Foundation president was a big deal; she is the first black woman\
      \ to be named to the post, and it was widely viewed as a coup for the black\
      \ conservative movement, which has been processing various stages of a prolonged\
      \ identity crisis. Issues of race and inclusion have only exacerbated by the\
      \ Trump movement\u2019s nationalist, anti-immigrant leanings, activists say."

      \ told congressional leaders that US Attorney John Huber, in charge of the District\
      \ of Utah, has been tasked with overseeing the effort referenced in Boyd's letter\
      \ to determine what additional steps \u2014 including the possibility of the\
      \ appointment of a second special counsel \u2014 are necessary.\n\nJustice Department\
      \ spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said in an email that Sessions asked Huber\
      \ to do the review shortly before Nov. 13 and that his review officially began\
      \ before Nov. 13 \u2014 the date when Boyd sent his letter to Congress.\n\n\

      \ Act \u2014 aimed at upping penalties for undocumented immigrants who try to\
      \ come back to the United States and restricting federal funds to jurisdictions\

    text: "\"Tonight\u2019s results show we are at risk of a #BlueWave in WI,\" Gov.\
      \ Scott Walker wrote on Twitter, after Judge Rebecca Dallet cruised to victory\
      \ in the first statewide election in Wisconsin since 2016.\n\nA liberal candidate\
      \ backed by Democrats won a statewide judicial election in Wisconsin Tuesday\
      \ night, a major warning sign for Republicans in a solidly purple state that\
      \ will play an important role in the midterm elections. The state's Republican\
      \ governor, Scott Walker, who is facing reelection in November, warned in a\
      \ series of tweets after the election that the liberal victory showed \"we are\
      \ at risk of a blue wave in Wisconsin.\"\n\nTonight\u2019s results show we are\
      \ at risk of a #BlueWave in WI. The Far Left is driven by anger & hatred --\
      \ we must counter it with optimism & organization. Let\u2019s share our positive\
      \ story with voters & win in November.\n\nIn a race that drew outsized national\
      \ attention despite its local nature, the liberal candidate, Rebecca Dallet,\
      \ racked up endorsements from national Democratic figures like former Vice President\
      \ Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker. Her conservative opponent, Michael Screnock,\
      \ is a longtime ally of Walker's who tried to paint Dallet as a liberal activist.\
      \ She, in turn, began her first ad in the race by criticizing Donald Trump,\
      \ who the ad said had \"attacked our civil rights and values.\"\n\nMany saw\
      \ the contest, the first statewide election in the Upper Midwest, as a bellwether\
      \ for Democratic enthusiasm across the region, where Donald Trump unexpectedly\
      \ won both Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016 and came within a narrow margin in\
      \ Minnesota. Conservatives have fared well over the past decade in statewide\
      \ Wisconsin elections, especially judicial races, where conservatives are typically\
      \ more motivated to come to the polls by issues like abortion.\n\n.@judgedallet\
      \ is the first candidate backed by liberals to win an open Supreme Court seat\
      \ since 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened Tuesday will be a significant\
      \ boost to Democrats \u2014 and is likely to worry Republicans, who were hoping\
      \ the state Supreme Court election would prove that traditional conservative\
      \ priorities still turn out voters in an election year where the political tide\
      \ was against them.\n\nInstead of a reliable stream of conservative voters,\
      \ turnout was weaker in places like Waukesha County, in the Milwaukee suburbs\
      \ \u2014 the same places that Walker will rely on to win in November. Meanwhile,\
      \ a surge of Democrats showed up in strongholds like Madison, home of the state's\
      \ flagship university, and in central Milwaukee. Dallet narrowed the still-wide\
      \ margins some in the Republican suburbs, and took home a staggering 80% of\
      \ the vote in liberal Dane County, home to Madison. Left-wing candidates tend\
      \ to win by big margins there \u2014 but not usually that large. Dallet also\
      \ performed better than Hillary Clinton did in some areas where Donald Trump\
      \ won in 2016 \u2014 another troubling sign for Republicans.\n\n#WI08 (based\
      \ around Green Bay) gave Trump a 56/38 win in 2016. Dallet is carrying it with\
      \ 51.4%. #WisconsinSupremeCourt https://t.co/8Tty6GX5zD\n\nVoters and outside\
      \ groups from both parties poured money into the race \u2014 more than $2 million,\
      \ at final tally. The state Republican Party gave $300,000 to Screnock, a huge\
      \ chunk of the $800,000 he raised overall.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democratic Party,\
      \ meanwhile, tested its ground game for the 2018 midterms, where they're hoping\
      \ to upend Walker and re-elect the vulnerable Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Their\
      \ efforts, a party spokeswoman said, surpassed anything they'd done in a spring\
      \ election. In central Milwaukee Tuesday, voters who turned out in freezing\
      \ rain said they were motivated by opposition to Screnock: his close ties to\
      \ Walker, as well as his endorsement by the National Rifle Association, which\
      \ Dallet's allies had sought to use against him. President Donald Trump, they\
      \ said, was hanging over the race, motivating people who typically did not show\
      \ up for April elections to come to the polls. Meanwhile, at Screnock's watch\
      \ party on Tuesday night, an intimate gathering of mostly friends and family,\
      \ some argued that there was much less of a national dynamic at play. \"People\
      \ in the Midwest are tough,\u201D said Jack Pender, Screnock\u2019s campaign\
      \ manager. \u201CThey brave the weather consistently and the like to get out\
      \ and vote. I think a lot of people probably did make the decision that it was\
      \ probably better safe than sorry\u2026and stay at home. It is what it is. It\u2019\
      s part of living in the Midwest.\" Screnock himself, who was interviewed by\
      \ BuzzFeed News shortly before election was called for Dallet, brushed off the\
      \ idea that a win in a swing state like Wisconsin signals that the the country\
      \ is in a wave \u2014 and that it was Dallet who politicized the race and made\
      \ it about the rest of the country. \u201CShe invited that stuff,\u201D he said.\n\

      \ seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in a race that has been seen as a bellwether\
      \ of voter attitudes ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\n\n\"People\
      \ are engaged, they are hungry for change,\" Dallet told her supporters Tuesday\
      \ night shortly after the race was called.\n\nThough judicial races are nonpartisan,\
      \ both Republicans and Democrats spent heavily and engaged voters in the state.\
      \ Former attorney general Eric Holder also prioritized the race as part of his\
      \ effort to shift the national redistricting map more in Democrats' favor after\
      \ a series of statehouse and statewide elections like these gave Republicans\
      \ a real edge over the past decade.\n\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker, a outsize\
      \ figure in Wisconsin, backed Michael Screnock, the conservative, while Democrats\
      \ lined up behind Rebecca Dallet, a liberal. (In the primary earlier this year,\
      \ Dallet defeated an Our Revolution\u2013backed candidate.)\n\nWhile addressing\
      \ her supporters, Dallet acknowledged money had flooded into the race, noting\
      \ that, \"special interests are definitely having an impact, and its on both\
      \ sides of the aisle.\"\n\n\"We beat the NRA and we beat the millions of dollars\
      \ that were spent on this race, flooding into our state,\" she said.\n\nScrenock,\
      \ in his concession speech to supporters Tuesday, said he would miss the opportunity\
      \ to work on the state's Supreme Court, but said he was proud to have continued\
      \ \"acting like a judge\" during the hotly contested race.\n\n\"I said for years\
      \ that we do not want politicians for judges,\" he told supporters. \"It was\
      \ very important to me and to my wife that every action that we took on this\
      \ campaign trail upheld the dignity of that office, and I stand before you with\
      \ my head held high.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, conservatives tend to do well in state\
      \ judicial elections, and currently hold a 5\u20132 margin on the state's Supreme\
      \ Court. In the past, conservative strength in April has boded well for Republican\
      \ strength in November.\n\n\n\nThough for a national audience the race might\
      \ seem a little obscure, the results offer a) a look at newly christened battleground\
      \ state Wisconsin's November elections, and b) demographic data that will give\
      \ us a better picture of how people are voting in Midwestern suburbs ahead of\
      \ the 2018 midterms.\n\nTwo years after Donald Trump infamously beat Hillary\
      \ Clinton in Wisconsin and undermined the \"blue wall\" in the Midwest, the\
      \ state will play host to two hotly contested elections later this year: Democratic\
      \ Sen. Tammy Baldwin's reelection bid, and that of Gov. Walker, who's running\
      \ for a third term after his noted battles with public-sector unions in the\
      \ state.\n\n\n\nTuesday's results may provide some insight into how those contests\
      \ will play out later this year.\n\nThe statewide nature of the election also\
      \ provides another big set of data for the midterms more broadly: In previous\
      \ special elections and 2017 contests, Democrats have outperformed expectations\
      \ in suburban areas, like Pennsylvania's 18th District, which contains parts\
      \ of suburban Pittsburgh. Rural turnout for Republicans has also been soft in\
      \ some places \u2014 like in last year's Alabama special election \u2014without\
      \ Trump atop the ballot.\n\nThe answers to these kinds of questions \u2014 if\
      \ Democrats can break into suburban areas in a midterm year, and if rural turnout\
      \ is lower than normal \u2014 give a clearer picture of what the fall could\
      \ look like."

    text: "\"The caravan makes me very sad that this could happen to the United States,\u201D\
      \ President Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday\
      \ called the caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants traveling up through\
      \ Mexico toward the US \"very sad\" and said he would deploy the military to\
      \ secure the southern border \"until we can have a wall and proper security.\"\
      \ The migrants, who are fleeing violence and poverty back home, have been marching\
      \ toward the US with hopes of applying for asylum, although Mexico has said\
      \ it will disband the group by Wednesday. Speaking at a working lunch meeting\
      \ at the White House with the heads of state from Baltic nations, Trump said\
      \ the caravan \"makes me very sad that this could happen to the United States,\u201D\
      \ adding that if it reaches the border, \"our laws are so weak and so pathetic\
      \ ... it's like we have no border.\"\n\nTrump also said that after discussions\
      \ with Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the US would deploy troops to the\
      \ border until there is a border wall and \u201Cproper security\u201D in place.\n\
      \n\u201CWe\u2019ll be doing things militarily. Until we can have a wall and\
      \ proper security, we\u2019ll be guarding our border with the military,\" he\
      \ said. \"That\u2019s a big step. We really haven\u2019t done that before, or\
      \ certainly not very much before.\u201D\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be the first\
      \ time. President Obama deployed more than 1,000 troops to the border in 2010,\
      \ as did President George W. Bush in 2006. Asked later when the deployment would\
      \ take place, Trump said there would be a meeting on it \"in a little while\
      \ with Gen. Mattis and everybody. And I think that it is something that we have\
      \ to do.\" \"Mexico has requested, through official channels, a clarification\
      \ about @POTUS announcement on the use of the military at the border. The Mexican\
      \ government will define its position after such clarification, and always in\
      \ defense of our sovereignty and national interest,\" Mexican Foreign Minister\
      \ Luis Videgaray Caso tweeted late Tuesday. Ger\xF3nimo Guti\xE9rrez, Mexico's\
      \ ambassador to the US, made a similar statement in an interview with CNN earlier\
      \ Tuesday soon after the president's comments: \"The Mexican government has\
      \ formally asked for clarification of the president's statement, both through\
      \ the State Department and the Homeland Security Department,\" he said. \"Both\
      \ countries share the idea of having a secure border. We do not always agree\
      \ on how to achieve that objective.\" The Pentagon and US Southern Command did\
      \ not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump also took credit\
      \ for Mexico's decision to disband the group, saying, \"I told Mexico very strongly,\
      \ 'You're going to have to do something about these caravans that are coming\
      \ up.'\" An official with Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Immigration (INM)\
      \ told BuzzFeed News their decision to disband the caravan was made unilaterally\
      \ without influence from the US or Trump.\n\nJO Rodr\xEDguez, a federal delegate\
      \ with INM, told me this was not in response to Trump speaking out against the\
      \ caravan. \u201CMexico is acting without pressure to find a solution to this\
      \ problem.\u201D\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome members of the caravan told BuzzFeed\
      \ News on Tuesday that they are still considering if they will accept an INM\
      \ offer for a humanitarian visa or the chance to stay in Mexico temporarily.\
      \ The president's comments about the caravan began earlier in the day, when\
      \ he tweeted that the caravan \"better be stopped\" before it reaches the US\
      \ border. \"The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico\
      \ and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets\
      \ there,\" Trump wrote in a tweet. \"Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign\

    text: "President Trump would probably win the New Hampshire primary if it were\
      \ held today. But at least one Republican who is considering running against\
      \ Trump in 2020 could make it a close call, according to new polling data shared\
      \ Monday with BuzzFeed News.\n\nAmerican Research Group found Gov. John Kasich\
      \ of Ohio trailing Trump in a two-way race, 42% to 48%, among likely Republican\
      \ primary voters, with 9% undecided. Trump leads another possible rival, Sen.\
      \ Jeff Flake of Arizona, 49% to 33%, with 18% undecided.\n\nThe results come\
      \ ahead of Kasich\u2019s third visit to the nation\u2019s first primary state\
      \ since ending his 2016 bid for president. He will speak Tuesday evening at\
      \ New England College in Henniker. Flake, who is retiring from the Senate this\
      \ year, made a trip to the state last month.\n\nIn 2016, polling analysts at\
      \ FiveThirtyEight graded the New Hampshire\u2013based ARG a C+, based on accuracy\
      \ and methodology. But the firm correctly forecast Trump, Kasich, and Texas\
      \ Sen. Ted Cruz as the first-, second-, and third-place finishers in that year\u2019\
      s New Hampshire primary, respectively, missing Trump\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s\
      \ vote shares by roughly 2 percentage points and Kasich\u2019s by 1.\n\nARG\
      \ interviewed 1,365 likely voters \u2014 420 Republicans, 400 Democrats, and\
      \ 545 undeclared \u2014 on landlines and cell phones March 21\u201327. The Democratic\
      \ sampling, like the GOP results, has a 5-point margin of error. The general\
      \ election sampling has a 3-point margin of error.\n\n\n\nWhile the primary\
      \ is nearly two years away, Flake and Kasich already are showing New Hampshire\
      \ the kind of attention typical from someone weighing a White House run. Both\
      \ are frequent Trump critics, and neither has ruled out challenging Trump for\
      \ the nomination.\n\nTrump\u2019s lead over Kasich in the ARG poll is just outside\
      \ the 5-point margin of error, but such a showing could be tight enough to weaken\
      \ his reelection bid. Pat Buchanan\u2019s relatively strong second-place finish\
      \ in the 1992 New Hampshire GOP primary was an early sign of trouble for then-president\
      \ George H.W. Bush, who won the nomination but lost in the fall.\n\n\u201CAt\
      \ the moment, Trump has not won over the hearts and minds of enough Republicans\
      \ (who say they will vote in the primary) to have a large enough lead to scare\
      \ away any serious contenders,\u201D ARG\u2019s Dick Bennett told BuzzFeed News\
      \ in an email. \u201CTrump is doing better than when he called New Hampshire\
      \ a \u2018drug-infested den,\u2019 but not much better.\u201D\n\nThe more anti-Trump\
      \ challengers in New Hampshire, the easier the path for Trump. In a hypothetical\
      \ primary where Flake and Kasich both run, Trumps leads the three-way field\
      \ with 51%, followed by Kasich at 34%, and Flake at 4%, with 11% undecided.\n\
      \n\u201CSome of the Flake and Kasich vote is solely anti-Trump, which is not\
      \ surprising,\u201D Bennett said.\n\nTrump has signaled plans to seek a second\
      \ term, which he\u2019s been raising money for since his inauguration last year.\
      \ He tapped a reelection campaign manager last month, and he and Vice President\
      \ Mike Pence have made separate appearances in New Hampshire in recent weeks.\
      \ But ARG also tested a GOP primary without Trump: a four-way field led by Kasich\
      \ at 36%, followed by Flake (11%), Cruz (7%) and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton (5%).\
      \ Without Trump as a choice in this scenario, a plurality of voters surveyed\
      \ \u2014 41% \u2014 were undecided. (It's hard to predict what a Trump-free\
      \ Republican primary would look like in 2020, but it would likely be crowded.)\n\
      \n\n\nARG also polled on several Democratic presidential prospects, but rather\
      \ than sift through a huge and undetermined field of potential hopefuls, the\
      \ firm looked at two one-on-one races involving former vice president Joe Biden.\
      \ In these matchups, Biden leads Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 58% to\
      \ 33%, and edges Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 47% to 45%.\n\nIn a general election,\
      \ Trump leads Warren (50% to 42%) and Sanders (49% to 45%), while Biden leads\
      \ Trump (53% to 39%). Kasich, the only other hypothetical GOP nominee measured\
      \ against a Democrat, leads Warren (52% to 37%) and slightly trails Biden (45%\
      \ to 46%).\n\n\u201CThe Kasich ballot against Biden confirms Trump\u2019s weakness\
      \ not only against Biden in the general but also in the primary,\u201D Bennett\
      \ said. \u201CTrump has to hope for an opponent who is disliked more than he\
      \ is disliked \u2014 this holds as well in the primary.\u201D"

      \ rise and fall as a Republican presidential contender hurt his standing at\
      \ home, also is carefully and somewhat quietly maintaining his national brand.\n\
      \nHis role last year as chair of the Republican Governors Association helped.\
      \ Walker raised money for (ultimately unsuccessful) candidates in New Jersey\
      \ and Virginia. He also planted flags in three states important to anyone with\
      \ White House ambitions by endorsing the new governor in Iowa, helping a top\
      \ GOP gubernatorial prospect in Nevada, and \u2014 beyond the scope of his RGA\
      \ duties \u2014 buying in early on the winner of a special House election in\
      \ South Carolina.\n\nWalker even went to bat for the Republican incumbent in\
      \ the unexpectedly high-profile race for mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, after Bernie\
      \ Sanders got behind her challenger.\n\nHis RGA chairmanship is over, but Walker\u2019\
      s efforts to influence races outside Wisconsin continue. Already in 2018 he\
      \ has headlined a fundraiser for Rep. Steve Pearce\u2019s bid for governor in\
      \ New Mexico, picked a favorite in Michigan\u2019s heated gubernatorial primary,\
      \ and chosen sides in a combative Senate primary in West Virginia by endorsing\
      \ Patrick Morrisey. This month he will headline a fundraiser for Illinois Gov.\
      \ Bruce Rauner, who survived a close primary and has perhaps the steepest challenge\
      \ of any governor up for reelection this year.\n\nThose close to Walker insist\
      \ his first priority is reelection in Wisconsin. But they also acknowledge that\
      \ Walker is methodical and strategic about his endorsements, and that a governor\
      \ whose political identity is rooted in a clash with organized labor and public\
      \ employee unions puts a priority on helping candidates who embrace conservative\
      \ principles consistent with his brand.\n\n\"Gov. Walker endorses candidates\
      \ who are willing to go big and bold, with reforms to state government that\
      \ take on the big government special interests,\u201D Brian Reisinger, a senior\
      \ adviser to Walker\u2019s political team, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nWalker\u2019\
      s activity is not unusual for a former presidential candidate or governor who\u2019\
      s still regarded as a bright prospect within his party. But it does underscore\
      \ the complicated relationship Republicans have with President Trump as midterm\
      \ elections approach. Many borrow from Trump\u2019s anti-establishment playbook\
      \ and hope for his support in tough primaries; others hope he keeps his distance,\
      \ especially in the fall. And that creates some space for an old 2016 rival\
      \ such as Walker \u2014 who, unlike, say, John Kasich, is not seen as a threat\
      \ to challenge Trump in 2020 \u2014 as a safe alternative. (Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\
      \ and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also have waded into the 2018 endorsement pool.)\n\
      \nWalker\u2019s judgment and coattails, at least locally, will be put to the\
      \ test Tuesday in a Wisconsin judicial election where a Walker ally is seeking\
      \ a seat on the state Supreme Court. And Democrats are planning an aggressive\
      \ campaign against Walker in November.\n\n\u201CScott Walker is more focused\
      \ on keeping his frequent flyer status than keeping his job as governor of Wisconsin,\u201D\
      \ said Jared Leopold, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.\
      \ \u201COver and over, Gov. Walker has put his national ambitions ahead of the\
      \ people of Wisconsin. Scott Walker\u2019s jet-setting has shown he\u2019s more\
      \ interested in his own national political dreams than the dreams of Wisconsin\
      \ families.\"\n\nAll of this political activity creates an opportunity for Walker,\
      \ still a young man at 50, to collect IOUs, should he decide to run for president\
      \ again down the line.\n\n\u201CGov. Walker knows what others know \u2014 that\
      \ Nevada is an important swing state, that this year\u2019s election for governor\
      \ is crucial, and that Nevada needs a strong conservative leader,\u201D said\
      \ Andy Matthews, a spokesperson for Adam Laxalt, the Republican frontrunner\
      \ for governor in Nevada for whom Walker raised money last year. \u201CHe has\
      \ fought for the ideas that will help improve the lives of the people of Wisconsin,\
      \ just as Adam will do here in Nevada.\u201D\n\nWalker\u2019s old-fashioned\
      \ conservatism and the fight with unions that led to a 2012 recall he survived\
      \ are part of the appeal. \u201CGov. Rauner and Gov. Walker share a commitment\
      \ to common sense reforms that make their states competitive in a 21st century\
      \ economy and promote good government,\u201D said Will Allison, a spokesperson\
      \ for Rauner\u2019s campaign.\n\nOther Republicans ascribe Walker\u2019s value\
      \ to his Midwestern, regular-guy personality. Call up his Instagram feed and\
      \ you\u2019ll see everything from photos of him on the job to a bitmoji of Walker\
      \ doing a glass-shattering slam dunk to celebrate a Milwaukee Bucks victory."

    text: 'Washington (CNN) White House physician Ronny Jackson''s performance during
      an extended grilling over President Donald Trump''s health and cognitive fitness
      played a part in his nomination for secretary of Veterans Affairs, a White House
      official told CNN Wednesday.


      The official said Trump liked the way Jackson handled himself with reporters
      during the briefing in January.


      Trump''s selection of Jackson, his personal physician, to replace Veterans Affairs
      Secretary David Shulkin immediately raised questions about Jackson''s experience
      and qualifications, according to multiple veterans groups and Capitol Hill sources.


      Asked how Jackson is qualified to oversee medical care for US veterans, the
      White House official noted Jackson brings with him both a medical and military
      background to the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as past praise for
      his work in previous administrations.


      The decision to nominate Jackson to run the government''s second largest department
      surprised members of Congress, veteran advocacy groups and officials within
      the department, the sources told CNN.

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will replace
      his Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin with Ronny Jackson, who currently
      serves as physician to the President.


      Trump thanked Shulkin via Twitter for his "service to our country and to our
      GREAT VETERANS" and said Robert Wilkie, the under secretary of defense for personnel
      and readiness, will serve as acting secretary until Jackson is confirmed.


      A White House official said the embattled Shulkin was no longer effective in
      his role, saying his "distractions were getting in the way of carrying out the
      President''s agenda."


      Shulkin is the second member of Trump''s Cabinet to be ousted this month, following
      Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . A handful of senior White House officials
      have also resigned or been fired over the last two months, fueling chaos and
      uncertainty inside the West Wing.


      Jackson, who is an active duty Navy physician, was nominated last week for a
      military promotion by the President. He was appointed as physician to the president
      by President Barack Obama in 2013, after having served on the White House medical
      team since 2006. He continued in that role after Trump came into office and
      quickly developed a bond with the President.


      "He''s like central casting -- like a Hollywood star," Trump told donors during
      a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago last month, according to audio of his remarks obtained
      by CNN.


      Jackson took on an unusually public role for a presidential physician earlier
      this year when he took to the White House briefing room to field questions about
      Trump''s health, just days after questions about Trump''s mental fitness for
      office were raised.

      Soured on Shulkin


      Shulkin''s departure from the administration is a stark reversal of fortunes
      for the VA leader, who served as undersecretary of health in the Obama administration.
      He''d been held in high regard by Trump, who publicly praised him and touted
      a series of legislative wins regarding veterans issues.


      Trump even joked last year that his signature phrase, "you''re fired" would
      never be used with Shulkin.


      "We''ll never have to use those words on our David. We will never use those
      words on you. That''s for sure," Trump said of Shulkin last June.


      Things soured early this year as Shulkin was the subject of a damning report
      from the department''s inspector general that found "serious derelictions" by
      Shulkin and senior VA officials on a Europe trip last year, and concluded that
      Shulkin had spent a good deal of the trip sightseeing and had inappropriately
      accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets.


      The report fueled Shulkin''s critics, both within his own agency and outside
      it, and brought into the open the power struggle over how to best care for the
      nation''s veterans. Expanding private health care for veterans was a talking
      point of Trump''s on the campaign trail, and a White House priority, and Shulkin''s
      critics have said he was a roadblock to achieving that goal.


      As the year went on, Shulkin grew increasingly isolated and at odds with top
      aides, including those in charge of VA communications efforts, was so wide that
      the secretary had recently been conducting his own crisis communications effort
      via his personal cell phone, telling reporters that there were political staffers
      working to oust him.


      Shulkin''s public comments rubbed White House officials, including chief of
      staff John Kelly, the wrong way. That frustration reached the White House recently,
      with Trump reportedly floating the idea in private of replacing Shulkin with
      Energy Secretary Rick Perry.


      His efforts to turn around the troubled VA were met with acclaim last year.
      However, over the last few months his standing with the White House grew more
      dubious, with political appointees saying that he wasn''t going far enough to
      advance the Trump administration''s goal of moving more care into the private
      sector.


      The inspector general''s report also damaged Shulkin''s standing, though he
      remained widely popular on Capitol Hill and retained the support of many of
      the nation''s major veterans organizations.


      The leaders of some of those groups publicly implored Trump to keep Shulkin
      on board at VA, saying they were concerned a potential replacement could be
      inexperienced or in favor of privatizing health care for the nation''s veterans.'

      physician Ronny Jackson his new choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs,
      bringing the military doctor who vouched for Trump''s health in front of the
      country to a key Cabinet position.


      The spotlight last landed on Jackson when he fielded questions from reporters
      at the White House on Trump''s physical in January. At the briefing, he pronounced
      Trump''s health "excellent" and dismissed questions regarding Trump''s mental
      fitness by saying he had "no concerns" in that area.


      Jackson noted during the question-and-answer session that Trump himself had
      asked for the cognitive exam and for the physician to give a thorough briefing
      to the press. A source told CNN at the time that Trump was pleased with what
      he saw.


      So who is Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson -- the doctor serving the executive branch

    text: 'Washington (CNN) The Justice Department''s internal watchdog announced
      Wednesday it has launched a probe into the department and the FBI''s handling
      of warrant applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.


      The review by Inspector General Michael Horowitz came after requests from Attorney
      General Jeff Sessions and members of Congress, the IG''s office said.


      For weeks, President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have pointed
      to the House Intelligence Committee''s controversial memo -- the so-called Nunes
      Memo -- slamming how the FBI obtained a FISA warrant to monitor Trump foreign
      policy aide Carter Page to argue that the nation''s top law enforcement agency
      is politically biased. The memo claims the FBI failed to adequately inform the
      judge who approved the warrant that it relied, in part, on opposition research
      funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton''s campaign.


      The IG "will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the
      time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source,"
      Horowitz''s office said. The investigation will also "review the DOJ''s and
      FBI''s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate
      to the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) applications."


      Sessions told reporters last month that Horowitz''s office was looking at whether
      the FBI handled the FISA warrant on Page properly -- prompting Trump to lash
      out on Twitter and causing Sessions to respond with a rare statement defending
      his "integrity and honor."

      possibility last year with lawyers for former national security adviser Michael
      Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort that the President might
      issue pardons for both men, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing
      three individuals with knowledge of the discussions.


      The conversations happened as special counsel Robert Mueller "was building cases
      against both men," the Times reported, which raises "questions about whether
      the lawyer, John Dowd, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about
      whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation" into Russian interference
      in the 2016 election.


      Dowd resigned from the President''s legal team earlier this month. In a statement
      to the Times, Dowd denied the report. "There were no discussions. Period," he
      said, according to the Times. "As far as I know, no discussions."


      In a statement, White House counsel Ty Cobb said he has "only been asked about
      pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons
      are under discussion or under consideration at the White House." White House
      press secretary Sarah Sanders referred to Cobb''s statement when asked about
      the Times'' report at a briefing Wednesday, later adding that pardons are "not
      currently" under consideration.


      Jay Sekulow, a lawyer representing the President, told the Times that "never

      of pardons of any individual involved in this inquiry."

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, the man who has come to love holding
      court on television and relished the art of the photo op, has remained out of
      sight for much of this week as allegations about a sexual relationship with
      a porn star play out on national television.


      Trump has not held a public event at the White House at all this week and spent
      Saturday and Sunday at his private club in Mar-a-Lago behind closed doors or
      inside the protected confines of his golf course. This means that although he''s
      been active on Twitter, he hasn''t had to face reporters'' questions about the
      ongoing saga playing out on cable news.


      Trump''s first 15 months in office have been in part defined by his frequent
      on-camera events inside the White House, with the President sometimes allowing
      extensive media access to meetings and debates even to the surprise of his guests.


      But over the last three workdays, the White House has instead held a series
      of closed meetings.


      Trump on Wednesday is scheduled to host a credentialing ceremony for newly appointed
      ambassadors before they are dispatched to their foreign posts. Then he will
      have lunch with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. On Tuesday, Trump received his
      daily intelligence briefings and signed an education proclamation before meeting

    text: '(CNN) Several top US law firms have left President Donald Trump with few
      places to turn for legal help in the Russia probe.


      Five large law firms are passing on the opportunity to represent the President
      after a shakeup last week on his private defense team and as he anticipates
      giving possible testimony to special counsel Robert Mueller''s investigation.


      Well-known Washington lawyers cited several reasons for declining the President
      in recent weeks, according to multiple sources familiar with their decisions.
      Among them, Trump appears to be a difficult client and has rebuked some of his
      lawyers'' advice. He''s perceived as so politically unpopular he may damage
      reputations rather than boost them. Lawyers at large firms fear backlash from
      their corporate clients if they were to represent the President. And many want
      to steer clear of conflicts of interest that could complicate their other obligations.


      "With a figure who is as polarizing as the President, it makes the decision
      about whether to represent him a more difficult one," said Philip West, chairman
      of large Washington law firm Steptoe & Johnson. The firm was among several to
      decline to represent Trump last year. "Any large law firm has clients that have
      very strong feelings."


      Even in a city with such a sizable legal industry, so many top lawyers and large
      law offices with white-collar and national security specialists have already
      been hired by witnesses, subjects and companies involved in the Mueller probe.
      Thus, few in town can take new clients at the center of it.


      The result is a previously unheard-of Washington problem: The President of the
      United States is struggling to build an experienced, large legal defense team
      as the special prosecutor digs in to his campaign and administration. His official
      legal defense team consists of two lawyers, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow, neither
      affiliated with a traditional law firm.


      The latest to turn down the invitation, Dan Webb and Tom Buchanan of the law
      firm Winston & Strawn, said Tuesday they "were unable to take on the representation
      due to business conflicts." Webb and others at the firm represent the Ukrainian
      oligarch Dmytro Firtash in a criminal money laundering case in Chicago, where
      he continues to face possible extradition from Austria. Firtash was previously
      a business contact of indicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort,
      making the Ukrainian potentially connected to the Mueller probe.


      "However they consider the opportunity to represent the President to be the
      highest honor and they sincerely regret that they cannot do so," Webb and Buchanan''s
      statement said. "They wish the President the best and believe he has excellent
      representation in Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow."


      While Sekulow, the leader of a non-profit religious advocacy legal group and
      a talk radio personality, is Trump''s sole remaining private defense counsel,
      Cobb works within the White House as a special counsel overseeing the Russia
      probe response.


      When asked who would lead Trump''s legal defense team on Tuesday, White House
      press secretary Sarah Sanders said that "the President has a highly qualified
      team." She referred further questions to Sekulow.


      Other lawyers who received recent requests to help with the Russia probe include
      former US Solicitor General Ted Olson; Emmet Flood, who''s worked for multiple
      presidents and still may join the White House counsel''s office; Robert Bennett,
      Bill Clinton''s attorney in the Paula Jones litigation; and Bob Giuffra, a New
      York litigator with the high-end firm Sullivan & Cromwell.


      Olson, Bennett and Giuffra all said no shortly after they were asked. The invitations
      became public last week when John Dowd , Trump''s private attorney for Mueller
      matters, quit. Dowd, who previously worked for a large firm and handled several
      high-profile trials, was central to determining Trump''s legal strategy and
      negotiating with Mueller''s office. Trump then failed last week to bring aboard
      a husband-and-wife replacement team to aid Sekulow, after announcing that Joe
      DiGenova and Victoria Toensing would join his team. Sekulow cited conflicts
      as the problem.


      A source familiar with the White House said other lawyers in Washington and
      New York have reached out to help and could still join the team. The person
      would not name those lawyers, or explain the timeline.


      Earlier this week, Bennett told Politico he hoped Cobb would leave the White
      House. "He''s not helping himself or his reputation," Bennett said.


      Olson said on MSNBC on Monday that Trump''s White House is in "chaos" and "beyond
      normal." Olson declined to speculate on what kind of legal help Trump may still
      need.


      Ted Boutrous, another top partner at Olson''s firm, said Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
      almost immediately declined to represent the President. Boutrous counsels Fusion
      GPS in court cases over the so-called dossier of Trump opposition research it
      funded. He wouldn''t speak about his law firm''s thinking in declining Trump,
      but pointed out how lawyers can''t take on clients when other clients'' interests
      might conflict. The firm also handled Facebook''s response to Mueller in recent
      months.


      Boutrous added the President is a "notoriously difficult client who disregards
      the advice of his lawyers and asks them to engage in questionable activities."


      (Another personal attorney to Trump, Michael Cohen, is caught in a legal fight
      over a nondisclosure agreement made on Trump''s behalf with the porn star Stormy
      Daniels.)


      Among the lawyers Trump has considered on Russia issues, Flood still may be
      willing to work alongside the President. He is a candidate for a position in
      the Trump White House counsel''s office, which handles official White House
      legal questions, such as the selection of judges and reviewing policy proposals.


      This isn''t the first time well-known attorneys declined to help Trump against
      Mueller. Several who were asked this year were also approached last year. Flood,
      Giuffra, Olson plus three others said no. Those lawyers were William Burck,
      who now counsels Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon and White House counsel Donald
      McGahn as Mueller witnesses; attorneys from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis; and
      trial lawyer Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson.


      Even so, Trump continues to receive legal advice from several commentators and
      longtime confidants. Marc Kasowitz continues to speak with the President regularly,
      for instance. Kasowitz''s law firm in New York, which advised Trump to push
      back against Mueller publicly early on, took a diminished role on the team months
      ago.


      The President has also tweeted in support of the legal punditry of Harvard Law
      Professor Alan Dershowitz, who has criticized Mueller. Dershowitz said he''s
      uninterested in officially joining the team.


      Trump has a few other large law firms and well-known lawyers still in his orbit.
      They handle everything from lawsuits to his taxes. Aside from the White House
      counsel''s office, those lawyers include Charles Harder, who is defending Trump
      in his Stormy Daniels litigation; the law firm Jones Day, which defends the
      Trump campaign in court; the Republican campaign finance expert and trial lawyer
      Bobby Burchfield, acting as an independent ethics adviser for the Trump family
      business interests; and the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, which set up a
      trust for Trump''s business assets last year.'

      running a radio ad this weekend touting his conservative mission and saying
      he "won''t stop until the mission is complete."


      The ad, paid for by Greitens'' campaign, does not explicitly address the controversy
      surrounding the Republican governor, but says liberals are "hell-bent on stopping
      his conservative reforms."


      "Even Satan''s own lawyers from the Satanic Temple are suing Greitens," the
      narrator of the ad says in reference to a lawsuit by the Satanic Temple against
      the state of Missouri over its abortion laws.


      The governor''s campaign has so far put $30,000 behind the spot, according to
      one source with knowledge of the buy. It is set to air Thursday through Tuesday,
      coinciding with the Easter holiday.

      reveals rare footage of American special operators and Afghan Special Security
      Forces conducting a nighttime raid targeting ISIS-affiliated fighters in Afghanistan
      -- footage that the Pentagon said documents the latest in a string of successful
      operations against ISIS-Khorasan this month.


      The first-person, night-vision footage was captured during a raid that "killed
      an ISIS-K commander and another terrorist fighter" in Afghanistan''s Jowzjan
      province on March 26 and 27, according to the Pentagon.


      "This tactical defeat of ISIS-K fighters in Jowzjan is the most recent in a
      series of Afghan and US (special operations forces) counterterrorism successes
      targeting ISIS-K in northern Afghanistan this year," a statement from the Department
      of Defense said.


      Many of the operations targeting ISIS in northern Afghanistan were focused on
      eliminating the organization''s ability to bring in foreign fighters, a hallmark
      of the terror group''s activities in Iraq and Syria.


      The Pentagon noted that US and Afghan forces killed four ISIS-K fighters in
      the Darzab district on March 22 and said a US aircraft successfully targeted
      two ISIS-K commanders tasked with the facilitation of foreign fighters in an
      airstrike in Sar-e Pul province on March 16.

    text: 'Washington (CNN) On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that President
      Donald Trump''s former lawyer John Dowd floated the possibility that Trump might
      issue pardons to Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort with their attorneys last year.
      Meanwhile, CNN has learned there was a discussion within the Department of Justice
      last summer, prompted by news stories speculating Trump could issue pardons
      via Twitter, over what would happen if he did decide to pardon anyone through
      social media.


      In emails exchanged between Department of Justice employees working for the
      Office of the Pardon Attorney, they concluded that if Trump decided one day
      to tweet out a presidential pardon, the Department of Justice would probably
      "have very little if any involvement," wrote Jennifer K. Mills, a former supervisory
      paralegal.


      Trump has already pardoned Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio , a Trump loyalist who
      now says he''s running for Senate, for a criminal contempt conviction in a case
      dealing with racial profiling. Some conservatives have preemptively urged Trump
      to pardon family members and associates caught up in Mueller''s investigation
      into the Trump campaign''s ties to Russia. At this point no one has been convicted
      on any charges arising from the investigation.


      But it''s very unlikely that the DOJ Pardon Attorney''s office would play a
      role in any decision to issue a pardon besides creating a formal record after
      the fact, unless Trump wanted the advice.


      The Pardon Attorney''s Office''s public mission statement says "all requests
      for executive clemency for federal offenses are directed to the Pardon Attorney
      for investigation and review."


      But those rules don''t carry the force of law.


      "Ultimately, we serve a support role to the President," Mills wrote.


      The emails, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request made by the
      whistleblower rights nonprofit Government Accountability Project and provided
      to CNN, reveal a candid exchange within the Department of Justice about the
      process by which the government''s legal body might be consulted on a candidate
      for a presidential pardon -- or pushed aside, depending on the President''s
      whim.


      The conversation arose in late July when various media outlets began writing
      about what would be required of Trump to issue a pardon. One DOJ employee sent
      around a Huffington Post article by Ryan J. Reilly referencing an interview
      with former US pardon attorney Margaret Love -- who said Trump could grant a
      pardon in any form he chooses at any time. USA Today''s Gregory Korte reported
      that Trump could do it in a tweet.


      Ian Prior, the principal deputy director of public affairs for DOJ, declined
      to provide further comment on the email exchange or the possibility of Trump
      tweeting a pardon. But Samuel Morrison, a former attorney in the Pardon Attorney''s
      office, confirmed to CNN that OPA''s rules are purely administrative, and that
      they "do not bind the President in the slightest."


      Trump cannot pardon anyone convicted of state offenses and most civil offenses,
      and he can''t preemptively pardon someone before they commit a crime, Morrison
      explained. Besides that, he has full authority. "Trump is right in this case,
      no one can tell him what to do."


      That has major potential implications.


      "He can shut down the Russia investigation," Morrison continued, comparing it
      to when President George H.W. Bush pardoned everyone involved in the Iran-Contra
      scandal in 1992, arguing that the case had devolved into the criminalization
      of policy differences rather than legitimate crimes.


      "These documents should warn us that we are clearly headed toward an unparalleled
      constitutional and accountability crisis," wrote Louis Clark, the Executive
      Director of the Government Accountability Project.


      Typically, convicts will follow a normal process, filing certain papers, letters,
      forms and petitions to the Office of the Pardon Attorney before the request
      is brought before the President for consideration.


      But Trump doesn''t technically have to do any of that.


      In the email exchange obtained by CNN, Mills references the case of Chelsea
      Manning , the former US Army intelligence analyst who leaked hundreds of thousands
      of military and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, writing that "in that case we
      did have a petition." President Barack Obama on his last full day in office
      offered Manning a commutation rather than a pardon, cutting her 35-year sentence
      to the approximately seven years she''d already served.


      Obama attempted to overhaul the backlogged Office of the Pardon Attorney during
      his tenure, which employed a small number of attorneys to handle hundreds of
      thousands of requests. The New York Times Editorial Board in 2016 recommended
      that Obama take the pardon process outside the endlessly mired DOJ process,
      and run it out of the White House by creating an independent commission -- in
      order to grant clemency to a larger number of people.


      The President has had this power all along -- though there are concerns among
      some legal experts that Trump might consider using it for friends and family.


      Mills and her colleagues additionally discussed the uncertain atmosphere within
      the government in the era of Trump. "We should be prepared for this, but who
      knows how to do that or if it matters at all," Matthew Pendergrass, Mills''
      colleague, wrote.


      "There''s no way to plan for the unexpected," Mills responded.'

      \n\"So true,\" he wrote. \"It's absurd. Which is why people are banging down\

      \ civil division. He later withdrew his name from consideration, though.\n\n\
      \"I am profoundly grateful to the President and to the attorney general for\
      \ selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice,\" Conway said in a statement.\
      \ \"I have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this\
      \ is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new\
      \ role in the federal government.\"\n\nHe added: \"Kellyanne and I continue\
      \ to support the President and his administration, and I look forward to doing\
      \ so in whatever way I can from outside the government.\"\n\nA source also told\

      \ a \"watered down, politically correct version\" to the Supreme Court.\n\n\
      Conway responded: \"These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly\
      \ won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad.\"\

      The email with the subject line "GOOD NEWS: We are asking about citizenship"
      was sent to the President''s backers and touts the move by the Commerce Department

      \ doubts that a meeting with Kim will ever materialize, even as Trump himself\
      \ has pressured his aides to make headway on organizing the historic encounter.\n\
      \nJust this month -- days before Trump quickly accepted North Korea's invitation\
      \ to meet -- senior administration officials told reporters the US would not\
      \ hold direct talks until North Korea takes \"concrete steps\" toward denuclearization.\
      \ That condition has since been discarded, but now those officials are working\
      \ to ensure Trump does not walk into his meeting with Kim with unduly high expectations.\n\
      \n\"I wouldn't say optimism is called for right now. I would be very cautious\
      \ because ... what North Korea expects out of this summit and what the US expect\
      \ may not be potentially aligned,\" said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst\
      \ and North Korea expert. \"Optimism is the last word I would use for this.\"\
      \n\nUS planning\n\nThe planning for a summit has included Mike Pompeo, the director\
      \ of the CIA whom Trump has tapped to become secretary of state. That shakeup\
      \ was announced on the heels of the diplomatic breakthrough, and senior administration\
      \ officials attributed the change to Trump's closer alignment with Pompeo on\
      \ the issue.\n\nAs the White House works to secure his confirmation, Pompeo\
      \ and a team at the CIA have been working through intelligence backchannels\
      \ to make preparations for the Kim talks. Meanwhile, officials at the State\
      \ Department -- led by Marc Knapper, the charg\xE9 d'affaires in Seoul, and\
      \ Susan Thornton, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific\
      \ affairs -- have been working separately to prepare for the summit.\n\nThat's\
      \ included the logistical work that goes into any presidential travel abroad,\
      \ including potential locations and necessary staffing. It's also encompassed\
      \ a thorough accounting of past attempts at talks with the North Koreans in\
      \ the hopes of identifying potential pitfalls.\n\nThe efforts have fed into\
      \ a working group convened by the National Security Council's top Asia hand,\
      \ Matthew Pottinger. But the leadership of the NSC is due to change soon. Trump\
      \ announced last week he was shoving aside his national security adviser H.R.\
      \ McMaster for John Bolton, the arch-hawk who has in the past advocated military\
      \ action against North Korea.\n\nIn appearances on Fox News, his former employer,\
      \ Bolton has praised Trump's willingness to meet Kim, even suggesting the summit\
      \ be held as soon as the end of March. But he's also warned against drawing\
      \ out negotiations, and has suggested the Trump-Kim meeting be cut short if\
      \ the President determines North Korea isn't serious about denuclearization.\n\
      \nWith Bolton and Pompeo at Trump's side, experts have said the US may take\
      \ a harder line against North Korea -- which could be newly emboldened by its\
      \ dialogue with China.\n\nA shifting timeline for the talks has reflected the\
      \ massive diplomatic undertaking. When South Korea's national security adviser\
      \ originally announced Trump's willingness to meet with Kim, he said the President\
      \ intended for them to occur \"by May.\" A week later, the White House said\
      \ in a description of a phone call Trump held with the South Korean President\
      \ that the talks were on track to happen \"by the end of May.\" On Tuesday,\
      \ press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to offer a deadline at all, saying\
      \ only that \"no time or date\" had been set.\n\nMany unknowns\n\nUS officials\
      \ say the talks will most likely take place in late May -- or perhaps even June\
      \ -- should they occur. It's also entirely unclear where the meeting will be\
      \ held. Officials and analysts have said the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean\
      \ border is a possibility, along with neutral sites in Europe like Sweden or\
      \ Switzerland, or even remote capitals, such as Ulan Bator in Mongolia. Trump\
      \ is not fond of the logistics of foreign travel, such as sleeping in foreign\
      \ hotels, people close to him have said. And Kim had never left North Korea\
      \ as leader before this week.\n\nThe White House has declined to say whether\
      \ official contact has yet been established between North Korea and Washington,\
      \ which would allow US officials to confirm whether Kim had indeed vowed to\
      \ halt missile and nuclear testing ahead of talks. In the absence of that confirmation,\
      \ Trump and his aides have relied partly on the characterizations of the South\
      \ Koreans, who came bearing the invitation earlier this month, and the Chinese,\
      \ who provided a briefing to the White House on Tuesday after Kim and President\
      \ Xi Jinping met in Beijing.\n\nAccording to Chinese state media, Kim told Xi\
      \ he was open to summit talks with Trump. But the North Koreans have not themselves\
      \ confirmed Kim's intent to meet with Trump.\n\n\"If South Korea and the United\
      \ States respond with good will to our efforts and create an atmosphere of peace\
      \ and stability, and take phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace, the\
      \ issue of the denuclearization of the peninsula can reach resolution,\" Kim\
      \ said, according to Xinhua.\n\nSome US officials saw Kim's surprise trip to\
      \ China as a sign of improving odds that talks between Trump and the North Korean\
      \ leader will eventually come to pass, saying Kim appears willing to engage\
      \ in diplomacy. But others saw the trip -- which occurred with little US involvement\
      \ -- as an indication that Beijing was exerting itself in the proceedings.\n\
      \nUS officials said they got no advance warning from the Chinese that Kim was\
      \ steaming toward Beijing in his heavily armored train for his first foreign\
      \ visit since assuming power. On Monday and Tuesday, senior officials in Washington\
      \ admitted they had little idea whether the mysterious hunter green locomotive\
      \ had indeed hauled Kim to China and not another senior North Korean official.\n\
      \nSenior administration officials spent Wednesday trying to decipher North Korean\
      \ intentions following Kim's meeting with Xi. Some officials noted the optics\
      \ -- including body language and rhetoric -- from both the North Koreans and\
      \ the Chinese was hardly warm and fuzzy, determining the meeting appeared like\
      \ it was for show.\n\nChina's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, traveled\
      \ to the White House on Tuesday afternoon to brief officials, confirming that\
      \ it was indeed Kim who had paid a visit to President Xi Jinping. In their conversations,\
      \ they dictated a message to Trump from Xi which was subsequently shared with\
      \ the President, who himself hailed the developments on Twitter.\n\n\"Received\
      \ message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG\
      \ UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me,\" Trump\
      \ wrote in the early morning hours of Wednesday. \"In the meantime, and unfortunately,\
      \ maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!\"\n\nReceived\
      \ message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG\
      \ UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the\
      \ meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained\
      \ at all cost! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2018\n\n\
      That message provided at least some solace to US allies, some of whom are concerned\
      \ Trump's eagerness to meet with Kim could lead to a loosening of sanctions.\
      \ In a statement, the White House said it regarded Kim's visit as \"further\
      \ evidence that our campaign of maximum pressure is creating the appropriate\
      \ atmosphere for dialogue with North Korea.\"\n\nJapanese role\n\nThe document\
      \ the Japanese are preparing ahead of Abe's talks with Trump will underscore\
      \ the importance of maintaining sanctions pressure on North Korea, the person\
      \ familiar with the efforts said. Tokyo hopes to warn Trump of ploys the North\
      \ Koreans have attempted in the past and \"traps\" they may seek to lay, the\
      \ person said.\n\nAbe and other Japanese officials have long been the most skeptical\
      \ players in the region about the possibility of direct talks between Trump\
      \ and Kim. They have warned that North Korea could simply be attempting to buy\
      \ time as it continues to develop its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nJapan\
      \ is also concerned the US could reach a deal with North Korea to restrict its\
      \ long-range missiles, while allowing the North to retain its short and medium-range\
      \ missiles that would still pose a threat to Japan.\n\nAmong world leaders,\
      \ Abe has made perhaps the strongest efforts to appeal to Trump, visiting him\
      \ in New York shortly after his election and gifting him with a golden golf\
      \ club. At an exclusive country club outside Tokyo in November, the two men\
      \ shared hamburgers and signed white ball caps that read: \"Donald & Shinzo:\
      \ Make Alliance Even Greater.\"\n\nHis anticipated visit to Florida next month\
      \ will be his second time at Mar-a-Lago. His first sojourn to the oceanfront\
      \ estate provided Trump a close-range view of Japan's concerns over North Korea.\
      \ When Pyongyang launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile during dinner,\
      \ the club's patio was transformed into an open-air situation room as the two\
      \ leaders discussed how to respond."

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Defense Secretary James Mattis is doing his best to downplay
      notions that he is concerned about working with President Donald Trump''s hawkish
      new national security adviser John Bolton despite signs of a shifting power
      dynamic at the highest levels of the administration and strong indications that
      the two men could clash over key issues like North Korea and Iran.


      One of Trump''s most trusted advisers, Mattis has clearly wielded significant
      influence since joining the administration and has demonstrated that recent
      staffing shakeups have done little to hurt his standing with the President.


      The weight of his opinion was again on display last week when Trump begrudgingly
      signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill after Mattis stressed it was a national
      security imperative.


      But the addition of Bolton, coupled with Trump''s nomination of another hawk
      in CIA director Mike Pompeo to replace ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,
      represents a dramatic overhaul atop the administration''s national security
      team that many argue leaves Mattis more isolated than ever.


      Mattis isolated?


      Mattis lost a particularly consistent ally when Trump unceremoniously fired
      Tillerson earlier this month, several sources have told CNN. The two secretaries
      had a close relationship talking regularly and meeting for breakfast or lunch
      every week. They often would work out issues together and present a united position
      to the President.


      Like Mattis, Tillerson argued against leaving the Iran nuclear deal and consistently
      stressed the importance of prioritizing a diplomatic resolution to tensions
      with North Korea, a source close to the White House told CNN.


      But while Mattis has been able to navigate a complex political minefield in
      a way that avoids drawing the President''s ire, sources close to the President
      told CNN that the same could not be said for Tillerson, whose firing was due
      in part to the fact it had become clear he was not on the same page as Trump
      and wanted to handle foreign policy his own way.


      Additionally, Trump himself indicated that he was looking for a secretary of
      state who aligned with his own way of thinking -- noting that he and Pompeo
      are "on the same wavelength" and "the relationship has always been very good
      and that is what I need."


      Initially there was also a concern that Bolton had not made it clear enough
      that, if tapped as national security adviser, he would "absolutely go along
      with Trump," a source close to Bolton told CNN.


      Ultimately, Bolton met with Trump at the White House and left with the job after
      he went over and above to make clear he will do exactly what Trump wants, the
      source said.


      Sources previously told CNN that Pentagon assisted the White House in an effort
      to transition McMaster out of his role of national security adviser by prospecting
      potential four-star military jobs he might be suited for.


      Several sources have also said that Mattis was privately opposed to the idea
      of picking Bolton as his replacement and tried to block him from getting the
      job -- though ultimately, Trump opted to go with Bolton anyway.


      Throughout his career, Mattis has demonstrated that he is by no means a dove
      when it comes to situations that call for the use of military force but the
      move to bring Bolton and Pompeo into the fold has sparked concerns that he may
      find himself at odds with two influential advisers who have previously supported
      more aggressive policy stances.


      And while Mattis has, to date, avoided publicly disagreeing with Trump, "he
      may soon have no choice but to start being more pointed in conveying his views
      where matters of war and peace are concerned, both behind the scenes and in
      public," according to Kingston Reif, the director for Disarmament and Threat
      Reduction Policy at the Arms Control Association.


      "The departures of McMaster and Tillerson and the arrival of Bolton and (pending
      Senate confirmation) Pompeo, leave Mattis more isolated in the administration
      and will reveal just how strong his influence on the President really is," Reif
      said.


      "At the same time these personnel changes make Mattis'' voice of soberness and
      pragmatism all the more important, particularly on Iran and North Korea," Reif
      added.


      Potential for conflict


      Specifically, it is Bolton''s hard-edged, hawkish views on issues like North
      Korea, Iraq, Iran and Syria that made him a controversial pick and could put
      him at odds with Mattis in the future -- especially with potential talks with
      North Korea looming.


      On North Korea, Reif notes that Mattis favors a diplomatic resolution and has
      warned about the potentially catastrophic consequences of military action. By
      contrast both Bolton and Pompeo have argued that using force to prevent North
      Korea from acquiring the capability to strike the US homeland with nuclear weapons
      is preferable to deterring/containing that threat, he said.


      There are similar disagreements over the Iran deal as "Mattis believes the United
      States should continue adhering to the agreement, while Pompeo and Bolton have
      advocated abrogating it," he said.


      But while it''s possible that Mattis may disagree with Bolton or Pompeo at times,
      Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies argues that
      it is not a forgone conclusion that different personalities are going to clash
      over policy.


      "Ultimately the buck stops at the President," Taleblu said, adding that as long
      as all three are working toward implementing Trump''s policy objectives there
      should be little reason for conflict.


      For now, both Mattis and Bolton have said they are optimistic about the road
      ahead despite their philosophical differences on many of the most urgent foreign
      policy challenges currently facing the Trump administration.


      Speaking publicly for the first time about the move to name Bolton as the replacement
      for outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Mattis said Tuesday that
      he looked forward to working with the former UN ambassador and that he hoped
      the two men held "different world views" to avoid "group think."


      "I''ll tell you right up front, it''s going to be a partnership, we are going
      to go forward," Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.


      A senior defense official told CNN on Tuesday that the Pentagon does not expect
      conflict at this point between Mattis and Bolton because the role of national
      security adviser is more of an "aggregator" than a "policy adviser."


      "We don''t see actual changes in policy" coming down the road just because Bolton
      is on the job, the official said, adding that while the President can always
      change his mind and look for a new policy, it won''t be Bolton dictating that
      change.


      But according to Reif, the elevation of Pompeo and addition of Bolton "could
      not have come at a worse time given the critical and hugely consequential near-term
      decisions facing the President on Iran and North Korea."


      According to Taleblu, Syria is one issue involving Mattis that Pompeo and Bolton
      may look to encourage a strategic shift on.


      "So far the war in Syria has been defined by the campaign against ISIS. Pompeo
      and Bolton may want to signal resolve against Iran by targeting Shia militias,"
      he said.


      Nuclear diplomacy is another issue to watch -- especially given the looming
      May 12 Iran deal deadline -- the next date by which Trump has to waive sanctions
      against Iran or leave the accord, according to Taleblu.


      If Trump opts to remain in the deal and signals a desire to broaden the scope
      of the talks to include other nations, Pompeo and Bolton would be the ones to
      give him the strong political cover he would be looking for, he said.'

    text: 'Hong Kong (CNN) The date for their meeting is still not set, but when President
      Donald Trump finally meets North Korea''s Kim Jong Un, the specter of China
      will also be in the room, a potent signal to the American President that the
      young reclusive leader has support for his cause from the region''s most formidable
      presence.


      Along with shoring up a rocky alliance, the two-day visit by Kim to Beijing
      was also designed to show Washington and Seoul that Kim wasn''t without his
      own diplomatic arsenal as he attempts to push for sanctions relief and recognition
      of North Korea as a legitimate nuclear power.


      South Korea admitted on Wednesday that it hadn''t been involved in Kim''s trip
      to Beijing. Senior presidential press secretary Yoon Young-chan told reporters:
      "What is happening now is beyond what the (government) has been predicting and
      (Seoul) will need to keep an eye on the situation with all possibilities in
      mind."


      "The very fact of this meeting alone, and certainly the tenor of the Chinese
      statement about it, really does increase Kim Jong Un''s leverage in the upcoming
      talks. It shows that Kim has a friend in Beijing," said Adam Mount, a senior
      fellow and director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American
      Scientists, where he covers US nuclear strategy, deterrence and North Korea.


      "It means the Trump team is going to be navigating really narrow straits here.
      It''s hard to overstate how dramatic this development is," Mount said.


      China ''will continue to play a constructive role''


      "We speak highly of this visit," Chinese President Xi Jinping told Kim, according
      to Xinhua, China''s state-run news agency, which reported on the visit after
      Kim departed Beijing. Xi added that China "appreciates the important efforts
      made by the DPRK (Democratic Republic of Korea)" regarding "positive changes"
      that have occurred on the Korean Peninsula this year, Xinhua reported.


      The messages out of both Beijing and Pyongyang following the visit are meant
      to emphasize to all parties that there can be no deal with North Korea without
      China''s involvement.


      Xi noted that "China will continue to play a constructive role on the issue
      (of talks) and work with all parties, including the DPRK, toward the thaw of
      the situation on the Peninsula," Xinhua reported.


      The "situation on the Peninsula" refers to not only the tension over North Korea''s
      nuclear program, but the presence of US troops to the south and the outlying
      waters where US and South Korean militaries regularly conduct naval exercises


      North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, his wife Ri Sol Ju, Xi Jinping and his wife
      Peng Liyuan pose for a photo at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.


      "To the US, denuclearization is denuclearization of North Korea. To Kim Jong
      Un, denuclearization applies to the whole peninsula, which includes the South,"
      said David Maxwell, retired US Army Special Forces colonel and a fellow at the
      Institute of Korean American Studies.


      "When the regime talks denuclearization, they require the South Korea-US alliance
      to be ended, US troops removed from the peninsula and an end to extended deterrence
      and the nuclear umbrella. Once that condition is met, then the North will begin
      the process of denuclearization," he said.


      Trump himself tweeted Wednesday that he''d heard from Xi about Kim''s visit,
      saying: "For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace
      and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was not even a small possibility.
      Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people
      and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!"


      ''Our greatest asset''


      The China visit has added a layer of complication for Trump that had long been
      dormant because of years of estrangement between Pyongyang and Beijing.


      Now that ties are seemingly mended, that bodes ill for the White House, said
      Mount.


      "The division between Beijing and Pyongyang was really our greatest asset with
      respect to North Korea," he told CNN. "If that narrows even slightly, that''s
      a sea change. It changes the outlook for negotiations that we have to adjust
      for very rapidly. It''s clear both Pyongyang and Beijing won''t be dictated
      to by Seoul and Washington, but also develop their own agenda. We should be
      aware that it might be a coordinated agenda," Mount said.


      The notion that might have held sway until this week, that North Korea was prepared
      to meet with Trump and put "nukes" on the table, is no longer the case, said
      Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and author of "Meltdown: The Inside
      Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis," who has made regular visits to North
      Korea in the past.


      "This didn''t look to me like a browbeating summit, that is not the dynamic
      at all," Chinoy remarked. Rather, it appears that Kim has been shoring up his
      alliances in anticipation of the meeting with Trump.


      North Korean leader Kim Jong Un smiles as he and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping
      attend a banquet at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.


      Daniel Russel, who helped formulate President Barack Obama''s Asia Pacific policy,
      agrees.


      "We might be seeing success in the North Korean effort to divide the five countries
      that have been involved in the effort. It''s a standard gambit for North Korea
      to try to undermine the unity of the international community," he told CNN,
      referring to the US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, which have historically
      been engaged in talks involving North Korea.


      He said it was "critically important" for the US to communicate and cooperate
      with China.


      "China might want a more modest settlement than the US wants, or can live with,"
      Russel said. "It''s on us, the US I think, to continue to find common cause,
      not only with China, but also with South Korea and Japan, and although difficult,
      with Russia."


      The John Bolton approach


      Trump''s newest national security adviser, John Bolton, a past US ambassador
      to the United Nations and noted hawk, has discounted North Korea''s sincerity
      , believing that the Kim regime''s appeal for talks masks a ploy to bide time
      until its nuclear program is up and running.


      Incoming Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has in the past advocated for regime

      "There''ll be very sharp battles in Washington between people who want to test
      North Korea and those who have been itching to pick a fight with North Korea,
      and may finally hope that this is their chance," said Chinoy.


      Some of that will depend on how large a role Beijing will play, and how much
      Chinese influence Washington is prepared to stomach.


      "We should not agree to allow China to host the summit or even be present at
      the summit," said David Maxwell. "That said, the best outcome for this summit
      is simply a meet and greet between Trump and Kim Jong Un, an exchange of positions
      and an agreement to allow the diplomatic experts to begin the process of negotiating
      an agreement," he told CNN. "We should not expect any breakthroughs."


      Kim Jong Un, left, and Xi Jinping, right, are seen at a banquet in this photo
      released by North Korean state media.


      And while the White House recalibrates its approach to the summit following
      the Xi-Kim meeting, it may have to brace itself for the entrance of another
      world power keen on not being left out of future gatherings: Russia.


      On Wednesday, Russia signaled its approval of the Xi-Kim dialogue in Beijing.
      The Foreign Ministry added that Russia aimed to continue close cooperation with
      China to resolve tensions on the peninsula by "purely diplomatic means."'

      Senate leadership expressing their "deep disappointment" in the Senate''s "inaction"
      in moving sexual harassment legislation forward.


      They are calling for a vote on the legislation that would overhaul how sexual
      harassment claims are handled on Capitol Hill.


      "We write to express our deep disappointment that the Senate has failed to enact
      meaningful reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995," the letter
      says. "We urge you to bring before the full Senate legislation that would update
      and strengthen the procedures available to survivors of sexual harassment and
      discrimination in congressional workplaces."


      The letter, sent to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority
      Leader Chuck Schumer, was spearheaded by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten
      Gillibrand and Patty Murray and signed by every female US senator.


      The House of Representatives passed a version of the legislation last month
      that would reform the Congressional Accountability Act, which set up the arduous
      process for handling sexual harassment complaints on Capitol Hill and would
      hold lawmakers personally liable for paying settlements.

      came from, what Cohen''s role was, and whether Trump consented to the agreement

      much since he took on the added responsibilities of being the President of the
      United States.


      : The news Wednesday evening is that a federal judge will allow a lawsuit to
      go forward that alleges possible illegal gifts or payments from foreign and
      domestic governments were made to the President.

      For a man so used to lawsuits and so happy with his pre-presidential winning
      record, however, it is this story by CNN''s Katelyn Polantz that is really eye-catching.
      The headline: An unheard-of problem: The President can''t find a lawyer. She''s
      writing about the Mueller probe and not the other lawsuits, but it''s still
      an incredible thing to read.


      The money paragraph:


      "Well-known Washington lawyers cited several reasons for declining the President
      in recent weeks, according to multiple sources familiar with their decisions.
      Among them, Trump appears to be a difficult client and has rebuked some of his
      lawyers'' advice. He''s perceived as so politically unpopular he may damage
      reputations rather than boost them. Lawyers at large firms fear backlash from
      their corporate clients if they were to represent the President. And many want
      to steer clear of conflicts of interest that could complicate their other obligations."'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) For President Donald Trump -- a creature of habit and
      routine -- once an adviser, always an adviser.


      Once a rising star inside the West Wing -- even being eyed for a promotion --
      Porter swiftly became persona non grata for fear any further White House contact
      would be taken as tacit approval of domestic violence.


      But not for Trump.


      The President has spoken with Porter multiple times since he left the White
      House, relishing his former aide as an outside sounding board and counselor,
      a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The New York Times reported Monday
      that those conversations have morphed into Trump pining for his Porter''s return,
      telling aides that he hopes his former adviser returns to the West Wing.


      While White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that she was not
      aware of any plans for Porter to return to the White House, but she did confirm
      that the President has talked to the former aide at least "one time" since his
      departure.


      Porter''s experience is far from unique.


      In fact, a series of one-time White House staffers who were deemed unfit for
      a Trump administration job -- for security clearance or personal reasons --
      have either been kept close to the President or made their way to the growing
      orbit of pro-Trump organizations.


      West Wing as Hotel California


      JUST WATCHED Longtime Trump aide John McEntee fired Replay More Videos ... MUST
      WATCH Longtime Trump aide John McEntee fired 01:33


      When John McEntee, a longtime personal aide to Trump, was fired and escorted
      out of the White House earlier this month for concerns over his finances and
      reports of a gambling problem, he spent mere minutes on the job market.


      That''s because, despite the concerns, McEntee was quickly handed a job at Trump''s
      2020 campaign, allowing the 27-year-old aide to transform his White House pink
      slip into a role as senior adviser for campaign operations.


      The revolving door gives the Trump orbit a Hotel California feel, where aides
      and advisers are able to check out of the confines of the Trump administration,
      but unable to truly ever leave the gravitational pull of the larger-than-life
      President.


      Reince Priebus became the shortest-serving chief of staff in presidential history
      when he was brusquely let go last year. But he''s since lunched with the President
      and continues to talk with him on occasion.


      Carl Higbie was fired from the Trump administration after CNN''s KFile reported
      on his racist, sexist, anti-Muslim and anti-LGBT comments on the radio. He was
      tapped earlier this month as the director of advocacy at America First Policies,
      a non-profit pro-Trump organization.


      And Corey Lewandowski , Trump''s one-time campaign manager who was fired in
      the midst of the campaign , remains closely linked with the President and people
      around Trump, making him a key White House surrogate who is known to have Trump''s
      ear.


      ''The best people''


      Keeping aides and advisers close is a hallmark of most typical politicians.
      Hillary Clinton, Trump''s 2016 opponent, was famous for her decades-old Rolodex
      and never truly excommunicating people from her world of informal advisers and
      outside aides. Trump has fallen into the same routine, even as he ran for president
      as a different type of politician who would only hire "the best people."


      The phenomenon is especially noteworthy because of the historic turnover that
      has plagued the Trump White House for the President''s first 14 months in office.
      With more aides leaving the administration -- some estimates find around 40%
      of top White House positions have been vacated during Trump''s time in office
      -- more jobs are needed to find these advisers a cushy place to land.


      This is what happened with Katie Walsh, the longtime Republican operative who
      came into the West Wing as Priebus'' deputy. After the Trump administration
      failed to pass health care reform, Walsh was ousted but transitioned directly
      to serve as a senior adviser to America First Policies.


      Enabling this boomerang effect is Trump''s emphasis on loyalty . The President
      craves faithfulness from all of those around him and has written about that
      desire throughout his decades-long career. While the longing doesn''t prevent
      Trump for kicking those aides to the curb, it does make Trump more likely to
      keep aides at arm''s length.


      "The thing that''s most important to me is loyalty," Trump said early in his
      career. "You can''t hire loyalty ... The thing I really look for though, over
      the longer term, is loyalty."'

    text: '(CNN) With the White House and North Korea''s tentative agreement for President
      Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to meet, Americans'' concerns
      about the threat from North Korea have abated and Trump''s approval ratings
      for handling the situation there have risen, according to a new CNN poll conducted
      by SSRS.


      Nearly two-thirds of Americans approve of Trump''s decision to meet with Kim
      (62% approve, 31% disapprove) and the President''s overall approval for handling
      the situation with North Korea has climbed from a November low of 35% to 43%
      now. That''s a new high for the President.


      The shift in tone between the White House and the North Korean regime seems
      to have eased Americans'' fears about the threat North Korea poses to the US.
      Overall, just 39% say the country is an immediate threat to the United States,
      down from 50% who said so in September, and 63% now believe the situation can
      be successfully resolved using only economic and diplomatic efforts, a 20-point
      increase since September. There is also less support now among the public for
      taking military action against North Korea should diplomatic and economic efforts
      fail to accomplish US goals. While 58% favored military action in that instance
      in a September poll, just 45% say the same now.


      The decreased concern about the threat posed by North Korea comes largely from
      Republicans and independents -- among Democrats, the share calling North Korea
      an immediate threat is about the same as it was in September -- but the shifts
      on the potential for diplomatic success and the need for military intervention
      have come across party lines.

      who worked for a Russian intelligence agency -- and that Gates knew of the spy
      service ties in September and October 2016, while he worked on the Trump campaign.
      Gates would have to talk about the communication with the man if prosecutors
      wanted, according to his plea deal.


      That''s in line with what prosecutors told Gates months ago during high-stakes
      negotiations, CNN has learned. They told him they didn''t need his cooperation
      against Manafort, according to a person familiar with the investigation, and
      instead wanted to hear what he knew about contact between the Trump campaign
      and Russians.


      The extent of Gates'' knowledge about any such contact or what he told prosecutors
      hasn''t been made public.


      As part of Gates'' agreement to cooperate with the special counsel a month ago,
      he earned a vastly reduced potential sentence and had several charges dropped
      in two criminal cases against him.


      Gates'' plea also adds to mounting pressure on his co-defendant Manafort --
      who so far the government is making a central player in the investigation --
      to change his plea and potentially help investigators. Under his plea agreement,
      Gates still could be called to testify against Manafort.


      Mueller''s court filing Tuesday night, in a separate case for a lawyer whose
      firm did legal work for Gates and Manafort, made public the most direct effort
      yet by Mueller''s team to draw a line between Manafort and the Trump campaign
      to Russian operatives. Prosecutors called the details of Gates'' contact with
      the Russian intelligence officer during the campaign "pertinent to the investigation."


      Russian contact


      The alleged Russian intelligence agent, referred to as "Person A" in the court
      filing, appears to be Konstantin Kilimnik, a former employee who worked with
      Manafort''s firm and lived in Kiev and Moscow, according to sources familiar
      with the investigation. In December, the Mueller prosecutors made a similar
      unnamed reference to Kilimnik, saying he is "assessed to have ties to a Russian
      intelligence service." That was related to a Kiev newspaper op-ed that Kilimnik
      helped edit in consultation with Manafort late last year, which prosecutors
      said could violate a court-imposed gag order on Manafort.


      The criminal allegations facing Gates and Manafort encompass work they did in
      the years prior to the 2016 election. Manafort has pleaded not guilty in two
      federal criminal cases stemming from Mueller''s prosecution, one in Washington,
      DC, and another one in Virginia.


      A chief criticism from President Donald Trump and his defenders has been that
      the charges brought so far by the special counsel don''t relate directly to
      Mueller''s central mission investigating possible illegal coordination between
      the Trump campaign and the Russian government, which the President and others
      often shorthand using the term collusion. The accusation related to Kilimnik
      and ties to Russian intelligence, made in Mueller''s Tuesday filing, begins
      to answer that criticism, but so far without actually making the charge in Manafort''s
      case.


      A lawyer for Manafort declined to comment. Kilimnik didn''t comment. Last year,
      Kilimnik told The Washington Post he has "no relation to the Russian or any
      other intelligence service."


      Gates'' current lawyer also declined to comment for this story.


      What Gates knows


      Gates may have information of value to prosecutors beyond his business dealings
      with Manafort, according to sources familiar with his role. He never grew close
      to Trump, but he had ties with other members of Trump''s inner circle, including
      Manafort and Tom Barrack, a fundraiser and close friend of Trump''s. He also
      developed a reputation for keeping tabs on what others were up to, one source
      said.


      Gates worked alongside Manafort during the critical summer of 2016 when senior
      campaign officials, including Manafort, met at Trump Tower in New York with
      a group of Russians who had promised damaging information on Democratic nominee
      Hillary Clinton.


      "Was he in the strategy meetings? No. But he was an implementer," one person
      said of Gates. So while he may not have participated in the Trump Tower meeting
      with the Russians, he may still have knowledge of the meeting or whether those
      Russians were ever introduced to Trump himself.


      "He would be the kind of person who would probably know that," this person said.


      Even after Manafort was fired from the campaign, Gates stuck around. He then
      went on to work with Barrack, while Barrack ran the presidential inaugural committee
      following the election.


      Legal team troubles


      Before the indictment, prosecutors had told Gates he faced the risk of criminal
      charges -- the beginning of a strategy to pressure him, according to two sources.


      Gates'' various legal teams -- and there have been many -- kept in touch with
      Mueller''s office throughout the investigation.


      Once prosecutors made a plea offer following Gates'' indictment, that offer
      never changed: He could plead guilty to a conspiracy count if he helped the
      investigation.


      In all, Gates held out for almost four months. He initially pleaded not guilty
      with the help of a public defender after he split with his previous attorney.


      He then hired three lawyers, who each worked in their own small firms, to take
      him to trial.


      But the financial stress on Gates mounted. He failed to pay some of his legal
      bills.


      "The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and
      the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much," Gates told
      friends and family in an email the morning he pleaded guilty.


      Despite the risk for Manafort and the cost, Gates engaged a third set of private
      attorneys, led by Thomas Green of the large law firm Sidley Austin, to negotiate
      his plea deal with Mueller in January and February.


      Even as Green finalized Gates'' plea throughout February, Gates wavered on his
      willingness to cooperate with the prosecutors. For months, he held on-and-off
      conversations with a fourth option for a private defense attorney to take him
      to trial: Barry Pollack. Pollack had previously worked closely with Manafort''s
      attorneys.


      At least three other well-known criminal defense law firms tried to help Gates
      over the past several months, according to multiple sources. One law partner
      made calls to find him lawyers, another two lawyers reviewed the financial allegations,
      and a third firm offered to get involved. Manafort''s attorneys were engaged
      in some of the efforts but not all.


      More recently, outside lawyers created a legal defense fund to help defendants
      in the Mueller investigation fight their charges.


      Yet it wasn''t enough. Gates never hired Pollack nor any other attorney to take
      him to trial after he was released from house arrest in early January.


      Prosecutors revealed after one of his interviews with the Mueller team, on February
      1, that they believed he had lied to them about a detail of Manafort''s lobbying
      efforts. The lie resulted in a second charge added to his possible plea. Gates
      chose to cooperate and plead guilty eight days later.


      CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that a legal defense
      fund to help defendants in the Mueller investigation was created by outside
      lawyers, not the Republican National Committee.'

    text: "Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions is not naming a new special\
      \ counsel to investigate Republican-driven accusations against the FBI -- at\
      \ least for now.\n\nInstead, Sessions revealed Thursday that Utah's top federal\
      \ prosecutor, John Huber, is looking into allegations that the FBI abused its\
      \ powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign adviser, and more should have\
      \ been done to investigate Hillary Clinton's ties to a Russian nuclear energy\
      \ agency.\n\nSessions' decision to stop short of formally appointing a special\
      \ counsel like Robert Mueller, detailed in a lengthy written response to three\
      \ Republican chairmen on Capitol Hill, will likely anger those in the GOP who\
      \ have recently ramped up calls to investigate claims of political bias at the\
      \ nation's top law enforcement agencies.\n\nHowever, Huber, who currently serves\
      \ as the US attorney in Utah , wields significant power as a federal prosecutor\
      \ with the ability to bring charges and convene a grand jury, if necessary.\n\
      \nSessions also said he will rely on Huber's review to determine if a special\
      \ counsel is needed down the line.\n\n\"We understand that the Department is\
      \ not above criticism and it can never be that the Department conceals errors\
      \ when they occur,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I am confident that Mr. Huber's review will\
      \ include a full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner\
      \ that is consistent with the law and facts,\" Sessions wrote. \"I receive regular\
      \ updates from Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive\
      \ his recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation\
      \ should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require\
      \ further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special\
      \ counsel.\"\n\nThe announcement comes one day after the Justice Department's\
      \ internal watchdog office confirmed it would review how the FBI obtained a\
      \ warrant to monitor Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page, as well as the bureau's\
      \ relationship with Christopher Steele, the author of the Trump dossier.\n\n\
      Top Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have said a probe by the inspector general\
      \ alone wouldn't go far enough, but Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley\
      \ did advocate for the selection of an independent US attorney in the event\
      \ a special counsel wasn't appointed.\n\nHuber may now find himself thrust into\
      \ the middle of a fierce partisan struggle -- with Republicans arguing anything\
      \ short of a special counsel is insufficient because the Justice Department\
      \ cannot investigate its own people, and Democrats maintaining that any allegations\
      \ of bias are an unfounded ploy to distract from Mueller's investigation into\
      \ possible coordination between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.\n\
      \nOriginally appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015, Huber, along with\
      \ many other US attorneys, resigned after President Donald Trump took office\
      \ early last year, but was reappointed by Trump shortly thereafter.\n\nFrom\
      \ Uranium One to claims of FISA abuse\n\nFor months, Sessions has tried to straddle\
      \ the line between adhering to the high bar set forth in Justice Department\
      \ regulations for appointing a special counsel in \"extraordinary cases\" on\
      \ the one hand -- and the persistent demands for one raised by some vocal Republicans,\
      \ including members of the President's legal team , on the other. His own involvement\
      \ in any decision is further complicated by the fact that he is recused from\
      \ all investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign. It was Deputy\
      \ Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who decided to appoint Mueller, not Sessions.\n\
      \nHouse Republicans nevertheless first urged Sessions to appoint a special counsel\
      \ last year to investigate various matters surrounding Hillary Clinton, including\
      \ how the FBI dealt with her handling of classified information, as well as\
      \ allegations that a Russian energy nuclear agency donated to the Clinton Foundation\
      \ in order to later secure her approval of its purchase of a uranium mining\
      \ company when Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe deal had to be approved\
      \ by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a committee that\
      \ includes representatives from several US government agencies, including the\
      \ State Department, which was led by Clinton at the time. The allegations are\
      \ unproven, and Democrats and Clinton say the allegations are false and an attempt\
      \ to distract from the Russia investigation.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity has\
      \ devoted considerable coverage to, as he calls it, the Uranium One \"scandal,\"\
      \ and Trump has scolded reporters for purportedly failing to highlight it as\
      \ the \"real Russia story.\"\n\nSessions in November managed to deflect from\
      \ making a decision on whether to formally appoint a special counsel by saying\
      \ he had directed \"senior federal prosecutors\" to examine the Clinton-related\
      \ issues, who would then \"make recommendations as to whether any matters not\
      \ currently under investigation should be opened\" and \"whether any matters\
      \ merit the appointment of a special counsel.\" He later referred to an unnamed\
      \ \"person outside of Washington\" with \"many years in the Department of Justice\"\
      \ who was examining the allegations.\n\nBut a steady cascade of revelations\
      \ this year have intensified the GOP pressure on Sessions to act -- including\
      \ news that top FBI officials involved in the Clinton private email server probe\
      \ and Russia investigation exchanged text messages disparaging Trump , as well\
      \ as that a Justice Department official failed to disclose his contacts with\
      \ the former British intelligence officer who assembled the controversial dossier\
      \ on Trump and Russia, and finally, that a House Intelligence Committee memo\
      \ that alleged the FBI failed to adequately inform the judge who approved a\
      \ surveillance warrant on Page relied, in part, on opposition research funded\
      \ in part by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign.\n\n\"\
      We do not believe the Department of Justice is capable of investigating and\
      \ evaluating these fact patterns in a fashion likely to garner public confidence,\"\
      \ House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and House Oversight Chairman\
      \ Trey Gowdy of South Carolina wrote in a letter to Sessions earlier this month.\
      \ \"[T]he public interest requires the appointment of a special counsel.\"\n\
      \nIn response, Sessions tapped Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look at\
      \ whether the FBI properly handled applications for surveillance orders under\
      \ the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- but that response did little\
      \ to satisfy Trump and Republican lawmakers, who pointed to the limited scope\
      \ of the inspector general's authority.\n\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking\
      \ the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will\
      \ take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on\
      \ Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers?\
      \ DISGRACEFUL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2018\n\
      \nAfter Horowitz confirmed his own investigation Wednesday, Republicans remained\
      \ stalwart that a special counsel was still necessary, citing limits on the\
      \ inspector general's power.\n\n\"For instance, the IG's office does not have\
      \ authority to compel witness interviews, including from past employees, so\
      \ its investigation will be limited in scope in comparison to a Special Counsel\
      \ investigation,\" Goodlatte said in a statement.\n\nSessions addressed that\
      \ issue in Thursday's letter, explaining how Huber and Horowitz will work in\
      \ conjunction, and attempting to dispel the notion that the inspector general\
      \ cannot interview witnesses outside the department.\n\n\"To be clear, the inspector\
      \ general has the authority to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, collect\
      \ evidence through subpoena, and develop cases for prosecution to the Attorney\
      \ General and the Deputy Attorney General for prosecution or other action,\"\
      \ Sessions said, adding that the inspector general may issue a public report\
      \ detailing his findings, unlike a traditional criminal investigation."

    text: '(CNN) A federal judge in California put a temporary stop Thursday to efforts
      by Stormy Daniels'' attorney to depose President Donald Trump and his personal
      lawyer, Michael Cohen over a $130,000 payout from Cohen to the porn star before
      the 2016 election.


      Judge S. James Otero of the US District Court for the Central District of California
      denied the motion for an expedited trial and discovery process, saying Daniels''
      attorney, Michael Avenatti, was "premature" in making the motion because Trump
      and Essential Consultants LLC, the company established by Cohen to pay Daniels
      the $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair between her and Trump, have
      not yet filed a petition to compel arbitration, which they have stated they''re
      going to do.


      In his decision, Otero admonished the parties, writing that "instant litigation
      is not the most important matter on the court''s docket." He also vacated a
      hearing date previously set for April 30.


      Avenatti told CNN''s Wolf Blitzer later Thursday that he does not view the ruling
      as a setback and is intent on waiting for Trump and Cohen "to file their motion
      to compel arbitration" before "immediately (refiling) our motion."


      "This does not bode well for the President or Mr. Cohen, and all indications
      are that when this motion is heard on the merits, we''re going to get the discovery
      and we''re going to get the trial we''ve asked for," Avenatti said.

    text: '(CNN) The Trump administration is taking steps toward an anticipated move
      to roll back greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy rules for cars, The New
      York Times reported Thursday.


      The newspaper reported that details of the initiative remain in flux, but noted
      that the plan "could substantially roll back the Obama-era standards," citing
      two sources familiar with deliberations over the move. An Environmental Protection
      Agency spokeswoman confirmed to the Times that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt
      has given the White House a 16-page draft proposal to review.


      A weakening of automobile standards would deliver a win for car manufacturers
      and a blow to environmentalists.


      Former President Barack Obama made regulatory efforts to fight greenhouse gas
      emissions -- and climate change -- a central focus of his second term in office.
      Those efforts were criticized by some Republicans, who characterized the EPA''s
      environmental regulations as government overreach.


      President Donald Trump campaigned on promises to cut back on environmental regulation.
      And last June, he announced his intention to exit the Paris climate agreement,
      an international deal the Obama administration had worked to negotiate. Trump
      has previously called climate change a "hoax" despite scientific consensus that
      climate change is real and caused primarily by human activity.

    text: '(CNN) President Donald Trump promised during the campaign to stock his
      White House with "the best people in the world" -- but it''s turning out more
      like "the best people in the immediate circle of people who I directly know."


      How else can you explain that within the last month or so, we''ve heard reports
      that Trump wanted to install his personal pilot as head of the FAA (although
      that report has yet come true) and then this week he installed his doctor as
      head of the VA?


      One of the things that helped Dr. Ronny Jackson get the job was that the President
      appreciated the way he defended Trump''s health during a White House press conference.


      Loyalty is the key theme of Trump''s management style.


      When his campaign needed some help back in 2016, he went to the Republican operative
      who lived nearest -- literally in Trump Tower -- to take things over: Paul Manafort.


      His daughter and son-in-law both ended up as senior advisers in the White House.


      His longtime bodyguard and head of security, Keith Schiller, got a key role,
      too, as deputy assistant to the President and director of Oval Office operations.


      And so did his former golf caddy, Dan Scavino, who became social media director
      during the campaign and is now White House director of social media and assistant
      to the President.


      It''s also how, at the ripe age of 26, Hope Hicks became White House communications
      director. She''d been with Trump throughout the campaign and, by all accounts,
      the President trusted her.


      He had already blown through more seasoned people in the role. Mike Dubke, the
      longtime Republican operative, had left quietly after a few months on the job.
      Anthony Scaramucci left after a few days.


      Hicks, already at the President''s side, ultimately got the big job.

      MUST WATCH Losing Hope: What it means for the press 09:21


      The problem is that Trump seems to be running out of people close to him who
      he trusts. Schiller left for a bigger paycheck


      Hicks resigned after she admitted to House investigators that she''d told what
      were described as white lies on behalf of the President and also became embroiled
      in the controversy around the denied security clearance of Rob Porter, the former
      Trump staff secretary with whom she was romantically linked and who was accused
      of spousal abuse by two ex-wives. Porter has denied the allegations.


      Hicks'' last day was Thursday. Now CNN''s Kevin Liptak reports the President
      is being told by some allies he doesn''t even need a communications director.
      Or a chief of staff. His relationship with chief of staff John Kelly has been
      up and down, and Liptak reports he has been finding ways around Kelly on some
      key decisions recently.

      shortly before making his way to board Marine One on the South Lawn and departing
      from the White House on March 29, 2018. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)


      Kelly took the job over after the previous chief of staff, Reince Priebus, left.
      Kelly was not a Trump insider, but first gained the President''s trust as his
      first Secretary of Homeland Security.


      By the way, Trump at first liked surrounding himself with generals, but had
      to fire the fiercely loyal Michael Flynn for lying to Vice President Mike Pence,
      eased H.R. McMaster out the door when the two didn''t really get along, and
      has been said to have soured on Kelly.


      Much of Trump''s problem stems from the fact that a lot of the top Republican
      talent simply does not want to work for him. He came to Washington promising
      to drain the same swamp that also is the natural habitat of top political talent.


      The other thing to remember here is that few ever seem to really completely
      leave Trump''s orbit once they''ve been caught in his tractor beam.


      Two former aides, Corey Lewandowski and Steve Bannon , have publicly pushed
      the idea that he could go without a chief of staff.


      And Trump has mused, according to reports, about bringing Porter -- with whom
      he is still said to talk -- back to the White House, though the President has
      has told advisers he realizes he probably could not do that after the allegations
      against him.'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Thursday that the US would
      "be coming out of Syria like very soon," just hours after the Pentagon highlighted
      the need for US troops to remain in the country for the immediate future.


      "We''re knocking the hell out of ISIS. We''ll be coming out of Syria like very
      soon. Let the other people take care of it now," Trump told supporters at an
      Ohio event on infrastructure.


      "We are going to have 100% of the caliphate, as they call it, sometimes referred
      to as land ... But we are going to be coming out of there real soon. We are
      going to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be," Trump
      added.


      One US defense official directly familiar with the ISIS campaign said it is
      unclear what the President meant by the comments. The military''s current assessment
      is that now is not the time to consider withdrawal, citing numerous challenges
      in Syria.


      The official pointed to several challenges, including figuring out what to do

    text: '(CNN) Utah US attorney John Huber was revealed Thursday as the person Attorney
      General Jeff Sessions tasked with looking into Republican claims of FBI misconduct
      and whether more should have been done to investigate Hillary Clinton''s ties
      to a Russian nuclear agency.


      Huber, who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations as a
      career prosecutor, nearly had his tenure as US attorney cut short last year.
      In March 2017, shortly after he took charge of the Justice Department, Sessions
      asked for the resignations of 46 US attorneys who were previous administration
      holdovers.


      Originally appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015, Huber offered his resignation,
      leaving his fate in the hands of the DOJ.


      But President Donald Trump re-nominated Huber in June 2017, and two months later
      Huber was back at his former post, confirmed by the US Senate for an additional
      four years.


      Last year, former DOJ officials raised concerns over Huber''s appearance at
      a White House press briefing to tout aspects of Trump''s immigration agenda
      -- something that critics argued blurred the lines of the DOJ''s independence
      from the White House, NPR reported at the time.


      During a June 28, 2017, press briefing alongside the director of Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement, Huber spoke on the behalf of the DOJ in support of
      two bills that sought to enforce harsher penalties for illegal immigrants --
      "Kate''s Law" and the "No Sanctuaries Act," both of which were passed in the
      House.


      "The reason why we are in support of these is that it adds tools to the toolbox
      of prosecutors in the Department of Justice to work on the violent crime problem
      that we have in our country and beat back this blip so it does not become a
      trend," he told reporters at the White House.


      "The tools that were given in these two proposed acts allow us to fight back
      against drug traffickers and transnational gangs," he said.


      Since then, Huber has taken on a leadership role on Sessions'' advisory committee
      of US attorneys that provide counsel to him and Deputy Attorney General Rod
      Rosenstein.


      Before becoming Utah''s top federal prosecutor, Huber clocked in 13 years as
      an assistant US attorney with experience handling violent crime and national
      security cases, according to his official biography


      During his first swearing-in ceremony as a US attorney, Huber was described
      as a "jock with the soul of a geek," a protector for others against bullies,
      and a man who lived by the motto: "Be the hammer, not the nail," according to
      The Deseret News'

      under fire for sweeping collection of Facebook data, issued an expanded statement
      Thursday about its practices in the 2016 US presidential election.


      In the statement , the firm reemphasized its claim that it "did not use Facebook
      data from research company GSR on the 2016 presidential election," a reference
      to Global Science Research, which gathered up data en masse on behalf of Strategic
      Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, according
      to a report in The Intercept last March.


      Cambridge Analytica''s statement said the Trump campaign hired it in June 2016,
      and from "August onwards," its data team used Republican National Committee
      voter files, polling, the Trump campaign itself, voting returns released by
      states and "consumer data available from commercial brokers."


      The statement said Cambridge Analytica did not "have the opportunity to get
      into personality models," relied on "audience segments that Facebook and other
      online platforms make available to all advertisers" and did not use bots.


      The statement is unlikely to quell concerns about the group''s actions and Facebook''s
      role more generally in US elections and public discourse.

      that Moscow "should not be acting like a victim" and rejected the Russian government''s
      suggestion that it is taking reciprocal action by expelling 60 US diplomats
      and closing the American consulate in St. Petersburg -- a move that followed
      Washington''s decision to expel 60 alleged intelligence officers from the United
      States earlier this week.


      "We don''t see this as a diplomatic tit for tat," Nauert told reporters at the
      State Department shortly after Moscow announced the move.


      The Trump administration announced Monday it would be expelling 60 Russians
      as a result of the nerve-agent poisoning of former spy Sergey Skripal and his
      daughter Yulia in Great Britain last month, which the US and its allies see
      as a violation of the international chemical weapons convention by Russia. Russia
      has denied any involvement in the attack, which the British government has attributed
      to them.


      "Russia should not be acting like a victim," Nauert said Thursday. "The only
      victims in this situation are the two victims in the hospital in the UK right
      now and the people who cannot go into the park, the medical workers, the first
      responders who are now having to be treated and watched carefully because they
      may have come into contact with that substance."


      Relaying a message from US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, Nauert said it
      was clear the Russian government was "not interested in a dialogue on issues
      that matter to our two countries."

      confirmed Thursday.


      The proposed rule change would substantially expand the type of benefits that
      could be considered as grounds to reject any immigrants'' application to extend
      their stay in the US or become a permanent resident and eventually a citizen.


      The move continues efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul the US immigration
      system and the changes could have the effect of substantially tipping the scales
      in favor of high-income immigrants -- all without requiring an act of Congress.
      The changes could amount to an effective income test of immigrants to the US,
      critics say.


      The expansion would going forward include programs like children''s health insurance,
      tax credits and some forms of Medicaid as black marks against immigrants seeking
      to change their status to stay.

    text: '(CNN) A fundraising page for legal defense funds for fired former FBI Deputy
      Director Andrew McCabe has been established, according to a spokesperson for
      McCabe.


      The spokesperson says the GoFundMe page has been set up "in response to a number
      of congressional inquiries that he will be required to respond to, as well as
      the broader Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigation that is ongoing,
      and any potential lawsuits he might consider."


      McCabe was fired earlier this month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions just prior
      to his planned retirement. In a statement on the decision, Sessions cited a
      report from the Office of the Inspector General, stating that the office "concluded
      that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked
      candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions."


      President Donald Trump cheered the firing of McCabe, who had previously worked
      under former FBI Director James Comey, on Twitter, writing "Andrew McCabe FIRED,
      a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - a great day for
      Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like
      a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest
      levels of the FBI!"


      A source briefed on the Justice Department Inspector General''s report said
      that it had concluded that McCabe misled investigators about his role in directing
      other officials at the FBI to speak to The Wall Street Journal about his involvement
      in a public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation.


      Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI
      - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made
      McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going
      on at the highest levels of the FBI!


      In a statement after his firing, McCabe charged that the decision was "part
      of this administration''s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special
      counsel investigation, which continues to this day."


      He added, "this attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not
      just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence
      professionals more generally."


      McCabe had been expected to retire on his 50th birthday, when he would have
      become eligible to receive early retirement benefits. His termination could
      place a portion of his anticipated pension, earned after more than two decades
      of service, in significant jeopardy.


      A democratic source told CNN that top Democrats in the House and Senate were
      in discussions about bringing him on board. There were serious discussions about
      where to land him, the source said. But a separate source close to McCabe said
      that he has no current plans to take a job on Capitol Hill.


      According to the GoFundMe page, the funds raised will be used for his legal
      defense, saying McCabe "will continue to fight for the pension and benefits
      he deserves, rather than accept any crowdfunding for that purpose. Following
      the conclusion of any related legal proceedings, any funds that remain in the
      Legal Defense Fund will be donated to charitable organizations of the McCabes''
      choosing."'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) A majority of Americans think President Donald Trump will
      lose his re-election bid in 2020, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS
      , similar numbers to those facing former President Barack Obama at this point
      in his first term ahead of his re-election victory.


      Fifty-four percent of Americans say they expect Trump to lose his campaign for
      re-election, the same number who said Obama would lose the 2012 election at
      this point in his first term. Only 40% of Americans think Trump will win in
      2020, similar to the 44% who said the same for Obama.


      Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect Trump to win re-election to the White
      House in 2020 (79% feel that way), while Democrats nearly unanimously say they
      expect him to lose (87% say so). A majority of independents also expect him
      to lose. Republicans now are more optimistic about Trump''s re-election prospects
      than Democrats were about Obama (just 69% of Democrats said they expected Obama
      to win at this point in 2010).


      Former President Bill Clinton faced even worse expectations in 1995, when only
      a quarter of Americans expected him to win his second term following deep losses
      for his party in the 1994 midterm elections. Trump filed re-election paperwork
      with federal election officials on Inauguration Day in 2017. He formally announced
      his re-election bid in February.


      Republican presidential primary 2020


      Trump holds strong support among his own party''s potential voters in a 2020
      primary race. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents,
      75%, say they think the GOP should re-nominate Trump in 2020. Only one in five,
      20%, say the GOP should nominate a different candidate. These numbers are virtually
      identical to Obama''s support among Democrats at this point in his term.


      But when those who want to see someone else take the party''s nomination are
      asked to name an alternative to Trump, no potential candidate has a clear edge.
      None of the potential nominees raised by respondents earn more than 1% support;
      that list includes Vice President Mike Pence, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney,
      House Speaker Paul Ryan, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, television personality Oprah Winfrey
      and retiring South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.


      Speculation about a Republican primary challenge has swirled around some anti-Trump
      GOP voices like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and
      Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who have refused to rule out a run for the White House.


      Democratic presidential primary 2020


      Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the most widespread support when potential
      Democratic primary voters are asked to rate the chances they would support six
      possible candidates for the party''s 2020 nomination.


      A broad 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they are likely
      to support a Biden bid for the Democratic nomination, two-thirds of whom say
      they are "very likely" to back his candidacy.


      Large majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents also say they
      are likely to support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (75%) and Massachusetts Sen.
      Elizabeth Warren (68%). Still, this support is slightly less intense than Biden''s:
      Six in 10 likely Sanders backers say they are "very likely" to support him and
      less than half of Warren''s likely supporters say they are "very likely" to
      support her.


      Both Biden, 75, and Sanders, 76, have not ruled out bids for the White House
      in 2020. Warren has said she isn''t running


      About half of potential Democratic primary voters say they are likely to back
      California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen.
      Kirsten Gillibrand. Roughly one in five say they aren''t sure if they''d support
      those latter three, lesser-known possible candidates. Only two in 10 potential
      Democratic voters overall say they are "very likely" to back Harris and Booker;
      only one in 10 are "very likely" to support Gillibrand.


      Sanders still has the strongest grip on young voters in the Democratic party:
      60% of potential Democratic primary voters under 35 say they are very likely
      to back Sanders vs. 52% for Biden, 29% for Warren, 18% for Harris, 16% for Booker
      and 12% for Gillibrand.


      Among potential Democratic primary voters, racial divisions also play a role.
      Six in 10 nonwhites, 61%, say they are very likely to back Biden''s candidacy
      vs. 52% of whites who say the same. On the flip side, 39% of whites are very
      likely to back Warren''s bid vs. only 25% of nonwhites.


      The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS March 22-25 among a random national sample
      of 1,014 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results
      for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage
      points. It is larger for subgroups.'

      director, at least in the traditional definition of those jobs, according to
      a person familiar with the conversations.


      Trump has absorbed the advice, but offered little indication whether he''s interested

      of running his White House without a chief of staff has been planted in Trump''s
      mind, and he''s not rejected it outright, the person said.


      Trump has expressed frustration at the management structure in the West Wing,
      believing it doesn''t suit the freewheeling style he employed as a businessman.
      And he''s persistently annoyed by headlines and television coverage of his presidency.
      After a year in office, he''s more willing to change long-established West Wing
      structures, people familiar with his thinking say.


      He''s begun working around Kelly on a number of fronts, including during some
      phone calls with foreign leaders, on certain policymaking decisions, and in
      executing some of the past month''s staffing changes, people familiar with the
      matter said. Kelly, meanwhile, has sought to bring further order to the policymaking
      process, including by naming Chris Liddell as his deputy for policy implementation.

    text: '(CNN) President Donald Trump used what was billed as an infrastructure
      event on Thursday to instead deliver a politically tinged address that veered
      from foreign policy to Republicans'' prospects in upcoming elections to the
      reboot of Roseanne Barr''s sitcom.


      Speaking before a crowd of union builders in Richfield, Ohio, Trump did lay
      out in the broadest terms the underpinnings of his infrastructure plan, which
      had been announced previously.


      But he reserved his most passionate language for the familiar themes of his
      political stump speech, including calling again for a border wall and touting
      accomplishments from his first year in office.


      Joking about his past as a real estate developer, Trump suggested he may have
      been better at his past job than the one he current holds.


      "I was always very good at building. It was always my best thing. I think better
      than being President, I was maybe good at building," Trump said, garnering laughs
      from the audience.


      The President also referenced photos he tweeted out earlier this week, which
      were taken in February and depicted replacement fencing at the border.


      On the wall, Trump came close to accusing Democrats of wanting drugs to come
      over the border.


      "They want people to come in from the border and they want, I guess, want, I
      can''t imagine they want, but certainly drugs are pouring across borders," he
      said. "We need walls. We started building our wall. I am so proud of it."


      Trump''s speech was billed as a pivot to infrastructure to tout the economic
      benefits of his proposals to help rebuild and repair America''s ailing system.
      But the remarks focused little on their stated purpose, and appeared more similar
      to a Trump campaign event than an official White House policy roll out.


      No comment made that clearer than when Trump lauded Roseanne Barr for the successful
      reboot of her sitcom . Trump applauded the new show Wednesday in a phone call
      to Barr, who plays a Trump supporter and is also one in real life.


      "Look at Roseanne -- look at her ratings," Trump, a man who has long been obsessed
      with ratings, told the crowd. "They were unbelievable. Over 18 million people.
      And it was about us."


      Senior White House advisers previewed the speech as a way for Trump to push
      for infrastructure reform, noting that the President''s Council of Economic
      Advisers released a report claiming the proposal could employ as many as 414,000
      additional infrastructure workers over 10 years.


      "Following on the success of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of
      the President''s successful economic agenda," White House press secretary Sarah
      Sanders said Wednesday. "These workers represent the hardworking Americans across
      the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our nation''s infrastructure,
      sparked from the President''s vision, and it will definitely be worth tuning
      in to see the President lay out that vision."


      But Trump spent considerably little time on the topic Thursday, instead using
      the speech to comment for the first time on a host of issues, like his decision
      on Wednesday to oust David Shulkin , the head of the Department of Veterans
      Affairs, and replace him with White House physician Ronny Jackson.


      Trump said he made the move because he "wasn''t happy" with the speed of veteran
      care and wanted veterans to be allowed to "run to a private doctor" if they
      wanted.


      The President also made news on international affairs, too, telling the audience
      that the United States will be "coming out of Syria" very soon.


      "We are knocking the hell out of ISIS. We''ll be coming out of Syria like very
      soon," Trump said before complaining about the fact that the United States has
      spent considerable money in the Middle East while it is considered too costly
      to invest in infrastructure in the United States.


      "We are going to be coming out of there real soon," Trump said. "We are going
      to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be."


      The President also compared the US-Mexico border, where he has pushed for months
      to build a wall, to the 160-mile-long demilitarized zone between North and South
      Korea, suggesting that it''s unfair the United States helps to secure one border
      but not the other.


      "Look at Korea. We have a border in Korea. We have a wall of soldiers. We don''t
      get paid very much for this, do we. You look at that, nobody comes through,"
      Trump said. "But our own border, we don''t take care of it. Think of it."


      He added: "We spend billions of dollars in other countries maintaining their
      borders and we can''t maintain our borders in our own country. Is there something
      a little bit wrong with that? Think of it."


      The speech was a good example of why there is little optimism about the prospects
      of Trump''s infrastructure proposals becoming law this year. Not only is there
      little appetite for any major pieces of legislation in Congress ahead of the
      2018 midterm elections, but Trump appears disinterested in staying on-message
      at events dedicated to the topic.


      If there is any movement, it won''t be in a sprawling piece of legislation Trump
      once envisioned. House Speaker Paul Ryan has favored a piecemeal approach to
      advancing the proposals, saying it could be done in a series of bills.


      A senior administration official acknowledged Wednesday that 2018 does present
      challenges, but said the administration is committed to tackling the issue over
      the long-term and said the White House believes pieces of Trump''s proposals
      will pass this year.


      "We will have a push, a strong push to have infrastructure done this year,"
      a senior administration official said. "We hope to get a big chunk done this
      year ... and what we can''t get done this year, we''ll get done next year."


      "We''re absolutely in this for the long haul," the official added.'

    text: '(CNN) If there has been a single, unbroken theme spanning President Donald
      Trump''s 14 months in office, it''s been his inability to stay quiet, even when
      silence would seem to serve him best.


      And yet, for more than two months, Trump has meticulously avoided personally
      addressing his alleged 2006 affair -- and his lawyer''s role in covering it
      up before the 2016 election -- with adult film actress Stormy Daniels.


      The streak is not unprecedented. On the advice of attorneys, Trump refrained
      -- for about a year -- from dropping special counsel Robert Mueller''s name
      into his Twitter current. And like so many of his predecessors, he embraces
      certain metrics, like a booming stock market, until their fates reverse, and
      the index levels. For the President, that''s about as rigorous as the messaging
      gets.


      Which is all the more reason Trump, in keeping buttoned up about Daniels, is
      turning political pundits sideways. What does it mean?, we can''t help but wonder
      -- then ask, and ask again, before gathering together at bar stools and in green
      rooms to debate with each other. The stats suggest a gap between interest, of
      which there is demonstrably plenty , and caring: Trump''s poll numbers are bad
      but up a bit in the latest CNN survey


      The fact is that, as far as Trump''s behavior goes, there is no clear cut answer.
      Implications, though, we''ve drawn a few.

      The White House declined to provide any additional details about the call, which
      occurred on a day when the President had no public events.


      But Trump himself chose to recount the conversation Thursday at the tail end
      of a nearly hour-long speech at a union facility outside Cleveland.


      "Look at Roseanne -- look at her ratings," Trump told the crowd, which had gathered
      to hear Trump deliver what was billed as an infrastructure speech but sounded
      instead closer to a political rally.


      He said he first took a phone call Wednesday from the producer of his "Apprentice"

    text: 'President Donald Trump''s approval rating in March jumped to 42% from 35%
      in last month''s poll, and congressional Republicans have closed the gap on
      the generic ballot from a 16-point deficit in February to just 6 points in March.


      On its face, it appears like Trump and Republicans suddenly got more popular
      since February, despite all the Trump scandals and bad press.


      Recall, however, that CNN''s January poll found that Trump''s approval rating
      was 40% and congressional Republicans were down 5 points. Those numbers are
      much more in line with CNN''s March poll, with the difference between 40% and
      42% in Trump''s approval rating and a 6- and 5-point deficit on the generic
      ballot for congressional Republicans not being statistically significant.


      So to paraphrase legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi , just what the heck is
      going on here? Are Trump and congressional Republicans really on the rise or
      is it only a statistical illusion?


      The answer is a little from Column A and a little from Column B. The President
      and congressional Republicans are up, but not by as much as it may seem when
      first glancing at the latest CNN poll.


      The way we know this is by aggregating all the polls that come out in a given
      month. These polls are of differing quality but aggregating a lot of polls helps
      to shrink the sampling margin of error and control for the occasional outlier
      result you should get when you interview about 1,000 Americans.


      In aggregating, we see that the Trump''s approval rating in March has averaged
      41% and congressional Republicans are, on average, down 8 points on the generic
      ballot. Both of these are very close to what CNN''s poll found.


      February''s average had Trump''s approval rating also at 41%, while the average
      generic ballot poll had Republicans down 7 points. January''s average placed
      Trump at 40% approval and Republicans down 8 points on the generic ballot.


      In other words, the President''s approval rating across all the polls over the
      last three months has been around 41%. The average Republican disadvantage on
      the generic ballot has been right around 8 points. These are right about where
      the average CNN poll has been over the last three months.


      So are Trump and the GOP completely steady? Not quite. While Trump''s approval
      rating over the last three months has been around 41%, it has increased from
      the second half of 2017. In every month but September (when he averaged an approval
      rating of 39%), Trump''s approval rating was 38%.


      The generic ballot has been more jumpy (in part because we have fewer polls
      to average), but we see the GOP is up here as well. Congressional Republicans
      were down 11 percentage points in December and 9 points in November.


      The difference between 38% and 41% for Trump and 8 and 11 points on the generic
      ballot over many polls is statistically significant. These are not necessarily
      huge jumps, however.


      And it is important to remember that Trump is still the most unpopular president
      at this point in his term.


      We can say pretty definitively, though, that the President and congressional
      Republicans are in a little better shape today than they were at the end of
      2017.


      The question then becomes why Trump and congressional Republicans are up, even
      with a seemingly unfavorable news cycle.


      The answer, like many things in politics, is probably a combination of a number
      of factors.


      As I''ve noted before, much of the negative news coverage recently that has
      focused on aspects of Trump only reinforce what people already think about him.
      For example, there''s the matter of Trump''s alleged affair with Stormy Daniels.
      Most voters already didn''t believe that Trump was faithful to his wife, so
      Daniels detailing her alleged affair with Trump on national television won''t
      necessarily give people new information to make them change their mind of him
      overall.


      There''s also the matter of the economy. Trump has consistently been viewed
      better on the economy than he has on most other issues. Now, though, Trump is
      getting more credit for the state of the economy than he had been. In Quinnipiac''s
      two latest polls on the subject , more Americans think that Trump is responsible
      for the economy than former President Barack Obama. Last year, more people thought
      Obama deserved more credit.'

    text: 'New York (CNN) Government ethics lawyers advised Ivanka Trump to make sure
      and keep her White House role separate as she planned to promote her new book,
      according to internal government emails .


      "Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success" was published May 2, 2017,
      after Ivanka Trump started advising her father at the White House.


      It''s not clear from the emails who first raised questions about the book, but
      the exchanges in the weeks before publication detail everything from rewriting
      Ivanka Trump''s Twitter bio to how she should respond to press questions.


      Walter Shaub, then the head of the Office of Government Ethics, suggested she
      have a "simple, rehearsed answer that she can use when asked about her book
      during official appearances," according to the emails.


      "The book is a personal project and I''m very proud of it, but I am not going
      to discuss it now because of government ethics rules," Blake Roberts, Ivanka
      Trump''s personal attorney, suggested she say.


      Ivanka Trump was allowed to promote the book on her personal social media, so
      long as it was clearly identified as a personal account and followed other government
      social media rules. Shaub also suggested not posting during ordinary business
      hours as "an extra precaution."


      Roberts emailed a snapshot of his client''s updated Instagram, Facebook and
      Twitter profile to Shaub on April 20, 2017, and thanked him for the guidance.


      "Wife, mother, sister, daughter. Entrepreneur & advocate for the education &
      empowerment of women & girls. This is my personal page. Views expressed are
      my own," the legally reviewed Twitter profile said, according to the emails.


      The bio remained on Ivanka Trump''s Twitter page for the next eight months until
      it was revised to include her White House position.


      The detailed legal correspondence with the Office of Government Ethics came
      about two months after President Donald Trump''s adviser Kellyanne Conway was
      "counseled" for using her White House position to promote Ivanka Trump''s fashion
      brand after it was dropped by department store chain Nordstrom.


      "Go buy Ivanka''s stuff, is what I would tell you," Conway said in a Fox News
      interview. "It''s a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully -- I''m going
      to just, I''m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody.
      You can find it online."


      In the emails about Ivanka Trump''s book, the ethics office allowed her to send
      copies to journalists and other contacts with personal notes enclosed, as long
      as she used personal stationary and did not invoke her government role.


      Her lawyers said she would not make appearances to promote the book, but would
      issue a press release on her personal or publisher''s letterhead saying she
      would donate the profits to charity.


      "You did not have concerns with that press release describing the book positively,
      as long as it stayed far away from suggesting that the government endorse the
      book or that it was interesting because of its author''s current position,"
      Roberts wrote to Shaub.


      In a statement published on Ivanka Trump''s Facebook page on April 20, she appears
      to have followed the ethics office''s and her lawyer''s guidance.


      "In light of government ethics rules, I want to be clear that this book is a
      personal project," a post on her page said. "Out of an abundance of caution
      and to avoid the appearance of using my official role to promote the book, I
      will not publicize the book through a promotional tour or media appearances."


      One email exchange highlighted the potential conflicts of interest when a White
      House staffer and presidential family member publishes a book.


      On May 2, Shaub forwarded Roberts a tweet from the Voice of America, a US government
      supported broadcaster, that showed a photo of Ivanka Trump in the Oval Office
      with the President, and a link to an article on the book.


      "It appears that someone there re-published an Associated Press article about
      the book and then tweeted it out," he responded. "I have checked with Ivanka
      and she had no knowledge of this."


      "I''m relieved to learn that she had no involvement," Shaub replied.'

    text: 'Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has agreed to represent two
      Reuters journalists who have been jailed in Myanmar and accused of exposing
      state secrets.


      The reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were arrested late last year while working
      on stories about the Muslim minority population in Rakhine state.


      Prosecutors in Myanmar have sought to charge the journalists under the country''s
      Official Secrets Act, a statute that carries a maximum prison sentence of 14
      years.


      Clooney said in a statement on Thursday that the reporters are being prosecuted
      "simply because they reported the news."


      "I have reviewed the case file and it is clear beyond doubt that the two journalists
      are innocent and should be released immediately," she said. "The outcome of
      this case will tell us a lot about Myanmar''s commitment to the rule of law
      and freedom of speech."


      Full coverage: The Rohingya crisis


      More than 688,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Rakhine State since August, when
      armed militants attacked security forces in the region. The Myanmar army responded
      by carrying out so-called clearance operations targeting terrorists.


      Those who have fled have told gut-wrenching stories of systematic mass rape,
      murder and the burning down of entire villages. The UN and the United States
      say they believe the violence constitutes ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies most
      of the allegations.


      Reuters published a special investigation that carried the bylines of Wa Lone
      and Kyaw Soe Oo in February.


      It documented a massacre of 10 Rohingya men reportedly carried out by Buddhist
      villagers and Myanmar troops. Reuters described the groundbreaking report as
      the first time that soldiers and paramilitary police had been implicated in
      testimony from security personnel.


      The report used photographs, reporting and interviews conducted in Myanmar and
      Bangladesh to reconstruct the final moments of the dead men, who were fishermen,
      shopkeepers, teenage students and a religious teacher.


      "The Reuters investigation of the Inn Din massacre was what prompted Myanmar
      police authorities to arrest two of the news agency''s reporters," the story
      stated.


      Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have remained in police custody since their arrest on
      December 12.

    text: 'Faced with a growing advertiser exodus, Fox News host Laura Ingraham apologized
      Thursday for a widely derided tweet in which she mocked Parkland survivor David
      Hogg.


      "On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt
      my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland," Ingraham said
      on Twitter. "For the record, I believe my show was the first to feature David
      immediately after that horrific shooting and even noted how ''poised'' he was
      given the tragedy. As always he''s welcome to return to the show anytime for
      a productive discussion."


      Ingraham, a staunchly pro-Trump commentator, came under fire on Wednesday, when
      she tweeted out a story from the right-wing website Daily Wire about Hogg''s
      rejection from four different colleges.


      "David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,"
      she said. "(Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance
      rates.)"


      The backlash was swift and widespread, and Ingraham was denounced for ridiculing
      a teenager and survivor of a mass shooting.


      "Laura Ingraham needs a few classes in compassion," tweeted the author Stephen
      King.


      Hogg, the 17-year-old senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas who has emerged as
      a leader in the nationwide movement for new gun laws following the shooting
      last month at the school, urged his followers on Twitter to contact advertisers
      for Ingraham''s prime time show on Fox.


      At least three companies were prepared to pull ads from the show, "The Ingraham
      Angle," in response to her tweet. Nutrish, the Rachael Ray-partnered dog food
      brand, said Thursday morning that it was "in the process of removing our ads
      from Laura Ingraham''s program." Travel site TripAdvisor said they "made a decision
      to stop advertising on that program." And online retailer Wayfair said, "the
      decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost
      his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values."


      By Thursday afternoon, after the companies announced their decisions, Ingraham
      took to Twitter to praise Hogg, saying that any "student should be proud of
      a 4.2 GPA."


      Ingraham''s act of contrition was seen by many as a response to the widening
      ad boycott. A year ago, Bill O''Reilly, then the biggest star at Fox, saw dozens
      of advertisers flee his top-rated program after a New York Times story revealed
      that he had paid multiple settlements to women who had accused him of sexual
      harassment or inappropriate behavior.


      Hogg, who has gained hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers in the last
      month, was dismissive of Ingraham''s mea culpa.


      "I 100% agree an apology in an effort just to save your advertisers is not enough,"
      he tweeted. "I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your
      network has treated my friends and I in this fight. It''s time to love thy neighbor,
      not mudsling at children."


      A short while later, Hogg tweeted a link to a list of Ingraham''s advertisers.


      "If you want to help I would suggest contacting 3-4 of these companies," he
      tweeted. "Lets do this"


      The unyielding response from Hogg drew its own critics, particularly from Ingraham''s
      defenders on the right. The conservative commentator Erick Erickson, who weeks
      ago called Hogg a "bully," repeated his criticism of the teen.


      "Having someone apologize to you then refusing to accept it unless conditions
      are met is what bullies do," Erickson said.'

    text: '(CNN) Ethan Sonneborn is an eighth-grader who loves basketball, fishing
      and writing.


      He also wants to be governor of Vermont. Not when he grows up, but now.


      And thanks to the fact that there are no state laws that require gubernatorial
      candidates to be a certain age, Ethan is officially the youngest candidate to
      run for that office in Vermont history.


      His challenges


      Ethan, who lives in Bristol, is campaigning ahead of the state''s Democratic
      primary in August, where he''ll face two challengers.


      His issue? Stricter gun control, legislation he says his home state needs.


      But being 13 poses some unique challenges for a candidate.


      One of them, says Vermont Democratic Party Executive Director Conor Casey, is
      school.


      "It''s funny, his biggest barrier is complications to being in school while
      simultaneously running for governor - not that I''m advocating that he drop
      out," Casey said.


      "Also, not having a driver''s license. He''s dependent on other people for rides
      to statewide events he speaks at."


      His platform


      Ethan says his age shouldn''t be a factor; his perspective should.


      His platform has featured gun control since he announced his candidacy in 2017.


      "I''ll admit when I first heard about a 13-year-old running, I thought, ''Is
      this some kid from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, spoiled?'' But that''s
      not the case," Casey said.


      "Ethan really did embrace the gun issue early on. He''s representing younger
      people and he''s been a good voice for them."


      Ethan acknowledges hunting is an important part of life in New England.


      "It''s a culture that I respect," he said. "But if it''s making the decision
      between letting my friends have a good time at a firing range and them possibly
      being involved in a school shooting, I''m choosing legislation to protect them
      from that school shooting."


      Sonneborn says part of his campaign is intended to disrupt the status quo.


      "There''s always been a sense of, ''We don''t talk about that in politics.''
      That''s what I wanted to change," he said.


      "I wish it didn''t take a tragedy for us to become involved in a national dialogue
      about how we move forward, but we can''t go back in time and make it that Parkland
      didn''t happen . And while we''re in this moment, I think it''s a good opportunity
      to make change."


      His upbringing


      Ethan''s parents aren''t very political, he says. But his passion was stoked
      early on when he bought an encyclopedia featuring Robert F. Kennedy at a local
      garage sale when he was 5.


      "I''ve always admired some of the great coalition builders of the modern era
      - MLK Jr., Robert F. Kennedy - who came from all walks of life to accomplish
      a common goal," Ethan said.


      "You don''t have to be a Kennedy or a faous minister to be a coalition builder,
      you just have to have an issue you care about and be willing to speak out on
      your platform."


      And he does that very well, says Jessica Barewicz, his principal at Mt. Abraham
      Union Middle/High School.


      "He has clear, concrete, research-based ideas for improving Vermont and society
      as whole," she said. "That is quite an accomplishment of concerted critical
      thinking, civic participation, and a visionary nature for a middle school student."


      Ethan says he''s met Gov. Phil Scott, who told him his gubernatorial bid is
      "very cool."


      Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos told CNN that while there''s no current
      law that prohibits Ethan from running, his office will likely discuss a minimum
      age for gubernatorial candidates in the next year.'

    text: '(CNN) A woman in Texas was sentenced Wednesday to a five-year prison term
      for voting illegally in the 2016 presidential election while on supervised release
      for a tax fraud conviction.


      When she voted in the 2016 election, Crystal Mason had already served almost
      three years in prison for her fraud conviction but had not yet completed her
      sentence and was still serving a three-year supervised release period, according
      to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.


      Convicted felons lose their voting rights in Texas until they complete their
      full sentences, including parole and probation.


      Mason reportedly told the court, however, that she was not aware of that prohibition
      and had not been informed that she was ineligible to vote until her sentence
      was complete.


      "She voted in good faith," Mason''s defense attorney J. Warren St. John said
      in an interview. "I don''t think she should be going to prison for that." Her
      attorney has already filed an appeal. "I think Texas law is extreme in terms
      of sentencing people to prison for voting violations," he said.


      Mason signed an affidavit in order to cast a provisional ballot, which stated
      that it is a violation of the law to vote if you are a convicted felon, but
      Mason did not see that part of the ballot, St. John said.


      "Ms. Mason was never asked if she was a convicted felon by the election judge
      nor did she indicate that she was a convicted felon," her attorney said. "Ms.
      Mason voted in good faith that she could legally vote because she was never
      notified by any government agency that it was against the law to vote."


      Prosecutors argued that Mason either intended to vote illegally or should have
      been aware that she was not eligible to vote, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.


      Matt Smid, a prosecutor with the Tarrant County District Attorney''s Office,
      did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


      The Star-Telegram reported at the time of her indictment that Mason believed
      she was being targeted for her vote -- which she said she cast for Democratic
      nominee Hillary Clinton.'

    text: 'Story highlights The actor and politician had successful open-heart surgery


      The planned procedure was to replace an older heart value


      (CNN) Former California governor and film star Arnold Schwarzenegger had open-heart
      surgery in California on Thursday to replace an aging pulmonic valve.


      His representative, Daniel Ketchell, said that the surgery was successful and
      that 70-year-old Schwarzenegger is in stable condition at Cedars-Sinai Hospital
      in Los Angeles.


      "Schwarzenegger is awake and his first words were actually ''I''m back'', so
      he is in good spirits," Ketchell tweeted.


      Schwarzenegger, who had a congenital heart defect, had undergone pulmonic valve
      replacement in 1997.


      That valve was "never meant to be permanent," Ketchell said, and had reached
      the end of its life expectancy, which was approximately 10 to 15 years. The
      value used in the new surgery was a less-invasive catheter valve replacement,
      he said.

    text: '(CNN) If President Donald Trump makes good on his promise to get out of
      Syria "very soon," one of the biggest winners will be Russian President Vladimir
      Putin and the Russian government.


      Although the Kremlin has tried to cast its involvement in Syria as primarily
      an air campaign, there are extensive Russian boots on the ground through military
      contractors, and a US withdrawal would make their job of combating forces hostile
      to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad considerably easier.


      Trump made the unexpected announcement on Thursday during an event in Ohio that
      was meant to focus on infrastructure reform . Trump, though, barely focused
      on infrastructure and instead held court in a campaign-style speech where he
      touched on everything from war and peace to the ratings of a new television
      sitcom.


      "We''re knocking the hell out of ISIS. We''ll be coming out of Syria like very
      soon," Trump told supporters outside of Cleveland. "Let the other people take
      care of it now."


      The comment caught much of the Trump administration off guard , leaving officials
      inside the Pentagon -- including some who had worked directly on the campaign
      to combat ISIS in Syria -- scratching their heads. It also contradicted a long-held
      Trump pledge to never telegraph future military decision.


      One defense official told CNN after the speech that it was unclear what the
      President meant. Even almost 24 hours after the remarks, a National Security
      Council spokesperson responded to questions about the comment by simply stating:
      "The President''s comments speak for themselves."


      And even those close to Trump were confounded. A senior administration official
      told CNN on Friday that some aides to the President were surprised by his remark.


      "We are still trying to figure out what he meant about Syria yesterday," the
      official said.


      Critical time in Syria


      The uncertainty around the President''s plans on Syria come at a critical time
      for the National Security Council. White House officials are bracing for staffing
      changes at the council with the arrival of new national security adviser John
      Bolton. It''s a "guessing game" as to which officials will be out the door,
      an official said.


      Any decision by Trump to pull out of Syria would also go against the current
      military assessment, a fact that left some national security officials concerned
      about the impact of a withdrawal, another senior administration official told
      CNN.


      The Pentagon''s current assessment is that now is not the time to consider withdrawal,
      citing numerous challenges in Syria. One issue is that the US leaving would
      create a vacuum in the area, similar to what happened after soldiers left Iraq.


      Additionally, the official noted unresolved questions, like what to do with
      some 400 foreign ISIS fighters being held by the US-backed Syrian Democratic
      Forces and a decision about whether the United States could accept a future
      where Assad remains in power.


      And most foreign policy experts believe that vacuum would likely be further
      filled by Russia.


      Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European
      Studies at Georgetown University, told CNN on Friday that "if the US were to
      withdraw, it seems to me the Russians would have a free hand" in Syria and the
      forces "fighting Assad would be weakened."


      Additionally, Stent said, a US withdrawal would help Iran, a country whose forces
      are fighting alongside Russians in Syria.


      "I do wonder if that is something the President thought about when he made that
      announcement," Stent said, noting that any departure would elevate Russia''s
      status to make it "the main power broker in that area."


      The involvement of both US and Russian forces in Syria has complicated the conflict,
      leaving the countries to do a delicate dance in order to avoid directly attacking
      one another.


      That hasn''t always worked, though.


      Several Russians hired as paramilitary contractors to fight with pro-Assad forces
      were killed by US air strikes in February, according to friends and family of
      those killed. The US and Russia have maintained "deconfliction" communications
      channels to avoid direct combat, but the lines do not prevent all conflicts.


      The conflict has also cost US lives. On Friday, a US official with knowledge
      of the initial reports from the battlefield told CNN that at least one US solider
      was killed in an improvised explosive device attack in the Manbij area of Syria
      on Thursday.


      US-Russia tension


      Trump''s suggestion that the United States is in the process of withdrawing
      from Syria comes amid simmering tensions between the United States and Russia.


      After the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed a consulate
      in Seattle, Russia responded by expelling the same number of foreign service
      officers and closing the consulate in St. Petersburg.


      Tensions between the two countries have boiled throughout the Trump administration,
      despite the fact that the President has avoided directly attacking Russia and
      dismissed most questions about Russia as nothing more than an attempt to discredit
      his 2016 election as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates Russian meddling
      in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.


      While Trump has personally remained silent, his administration has confronted
      Russia . The administration unveiled new sanctions on Russia earlier this year,
      punishing individuals indicted by Mueller in February in a sweeping new effort
      to come down on Moscow for its interference in the 2016 election.


      Ever since taking office, Trump has been in the middle of a tug-of-war between
      his desire to appear like a strongman president and his campaign promise to
      withdraw the United States from foreign conflicts.


      While Trump has frequently touted the gains made against ISIS since taking office,
      he repeatedly slammed President George W. Bush''s handling of the Iraq war during
      the 2016 campaign.


      "General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their graves
      at the stupidity of what we''re doing in the Middle East," Trump said during
      a presidential debate to slam Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state.


      As president, however, Trump has only maintained foreign involvement in wars.
      Last year, for example, Trump vowed the US will "fight to win" in Afghanistan,
      extending a 16-year war that he once proposed fully ending.'

      \ by CNN, Sidib\xE9 denied being warned. He also praised Loures' decision to\
      \ leave the UN as \"courageous\" and attacked employees who spoke publicly about\
      \ sexual harassment claims at the UN, saying \"they don't have [a] moral approach.\"\
      \n\nThe allegations point to a deep irony: While the UN's HIV/AIDS program has\
      \ long promoted the empowerment of women as crucial to ending the epidemic,\
      \ multiple activists and former UN employees tell CNN that the organization\
      \ has also long protected an executive dogged by claims of sexual harassment.\n\
      \nThose critics of the UN say it has failed to take allegations of sexual assault\
      \ seriously, prioritizing the reputation of the organization over its obligations\
      \ to protect employees.\n\nThe UN says it is redoubling its efforts to combat\
      \ harassment, encourage reporting, and protect accusers from retaliation.\n\n\
      Paula Donovan, whose campaign group Code Blue is pushing for changes in how\
      \ the UN handles sexual harassment complaints, has spearheaded Brostrom's public\
      \ appeal and raised concerns in open letters to the UN Secretary-General, Antonio\
      \ Guterres.\n\nDonovan said the UN should not be allowed to police itself. \"\
      I think the term that is not used often enough is the obvious conflict of interest.\
      \ The UN simply cannot possibly play this role.\" Code Blue is calling for an\
      \ \"external, neutral, and independent body\" to handle such allegations.\n\n\
      Stephen Lewis, a former senior official at UNICEF who now co-runs an NGO that\
      \ works on AIDS policy with Donovan, says UN officials hold to a view that its\
      \ reputation is sacrosanct. \"There is an understanding that under no circumstances\
      \ can you put the UN at risk,\" says Lewis, who has advocated on Brostrom's\
      \ behalf.\n\nBangkok conference\n\nBy the time Martina Brostrom arrived in Bangkok,\
      \ Thailand for a conference in May 2015, she says she already knew to be wary\
      \ of Luiz Loures.\n\nHe would \"let his hand slide, you know, over your hair\
      \ and sort of hold you behind the neck,\" she recalled of a typically unwelcome\
      \ interaction.\n\nAt that Bangkok conference, following what she described as\
      \ a reluctant work chat after a reception, they got into the hotel elevator.\
      \ Then, she said, he lunged at her.\n\n\"I'm pushed towards the wall,\" she\
      \ told Amanpour. \"He starts shoving his tongue into my mouth, trying to kiss\
      \ me. And he is groping my body, including my breasts. The elevator door opens\
      \ and he tries to forcefully pull me out of the elevator -- drag me towards\
      \ the corridor of his room.\"\n\n\"He says, 'Come, come in my room.'\"\n\nShe\
      \ managed to hold him off, she said, escaping back into the elevator and to\
      \ her own room.\n\nA colleague with whom she spoke on the night of the alleged\
      \ incident confirmed to CNN the story Brostrom relayed at the time, saying she\
      \ had been \"absolutely distraught.\"\n\nHer mother, supervisor and two other\
      \ coworkers who say they saw or spoke to her that night gave investigators similar\
      \ descriptions of her demeanor -- \"upset, crying, and distressed,\" as the\
      \ investigation put it.\n\nBrostrom did not immediately file a formal complaint.\
      \ She said she feared that her allegations would be disregarded, or that she\
      \ could face retaliation. A year later she said she made Sidib\xE9 aware informally,\
      \ a claim he denies.\n\nSeveral months later -- about a year and a half after\
      \ the alleged assault -- she says it became clear to her that a reorganization\
      \ could make Loures one of her direct supervisors, with only a \"weak manager\"\
      \ -- whom she says was unaware of the alleged assault -- separating the two.\n\
      \nShe asked Sidib\xE9 to open an investigation, which he did.\n\nBrostrom said\
      \ she has been on paid sick leave more or less continuously since April last\
      \ year. According to a medical evaluation from June that she provided to CNN,\
      \ she is suffering from post-traumatic stress from an incident in May 2015.\n\
      \n\"What has happened to me, how the situation has been mishandled -- it mustn't\
      \ happen to any other woman,\" she told Amanpour.\n\nConfidential investigation\n\
      \nCNN has obtained a copy of the confidential inquiry that cleared Loures, as\
      \ well as transcripts of interviews conducted by investigators. In interviews\
      \ with investigators, Loures vehemently denied that an assault took place, calling\
      \ it \"a false story.\"\n\nHe at first suggested to investigators that she had\
      \ had too much to drink, then told him something he briefly suggested could\
      \ be subject to doctor-patient confidentiality.\n\nLoures suggested that Brostrom\
      \ had spoken about \"how she behaves sexually\" and told him \"you could never\
      \ handle me.\" Loures also raised the fact that Brostrom is now in a relationship\
      \ with her then supervisor, who also spoke with investigators.\n\nShe told CNN\
      \ she was not drunk, has never been Loures' patient, and had \"absolutely not\"\
      \ spoken with him about her sexual preferences. She called Loures' reference\
      \ to her current relationship as an attempt to \"draw attention from what really\
      \ matters,\" and said the romance \"evolved as a consequence of what has happened\
      \ to me\" and the support her partner offered.\n\nSimilar allegation\n\nMalayah\
      \ Harper, who used to run UNAIDS' programs in Uganda and Kenya, told CNN that\
      \ she nearly fell off her chair when she first heard of Brostrom's account.\n\
      \nThat's because Harper says Loures assaulted her in an almost identical way,\
      \ a year earlier, also at a hotel.\n\n\"He got into the lift with me, and then\
      \ kind of lunged forward to -- you could call it -- kiss me, but I thought a\
      \ kiss had to be consensual.\"\n\nA third woman, who still works in the UN system\
      \ and wished to remain anonymous, described a very similar incident with Loures.\n\
      \n\"He forced himself on me,\" she told CNN. He \"stuck his tongue in my mouth,\
      \ tried to touch me all over, into my blouse.\"\n\nLoures' behavior had \"become\
      \ a joke in Geneva,\" said a person who has worked with the UN and has known\
      \ the UNAIDS executive director, Michel Sidib\xE9, for years.\n\nMichel Sidib\xE9\
      , executive director of UNAIDS, speaks at the UN in 2011.\n\n\"Someone said\
      \ to me the other day you'd see a bunch of young women in tight skirts somewhere\
      \ around UNAIDS and you'd say, 'Oh, Luiz must be nearby.'\"\n\nCNN offered Loures\
      \ an on-camera interview. He declined, but sent a statement denying Brostrom's\
      \ allegations. \"I cooperated fully with the independent investigation and provided\
      \ proof of my innocence,\" he said. \"The claims against me were unsubstantiated.\"\
      \n\nHe also denied Malayah Harper's allegation, saying he was \"surprised\"\
      \ to hear it. Harper never filed a formal complaint but UNAIDS told CNN that\
      \ it would investigate her allegations if she did.\n\nPromotion claim\n\nMonths\
      \ into the investigation into Brostrom's allegations, she said, Sidib\xE9 pressured\
      \ her during a trip to Stockholm to abandon it and accept an apology from Loures\
      \ in exchange for a promotion.\n\nSidib\xE9 denied to investigators that Loures\
      \ wanted to apologize.\n\nBut he did admit to investigators in a follow-up interview\
      \ that he told Brostrom that it would be good to \"find a way out\" in a way\
      \ that would protect the organization and, he says, \"for yourself.\" Given\
      \ that he was \"very happy\" with her work, and she had been talking about her\
      \ promotion, he recalled suggesting they \"have a discussion between us to just\
      \ understand how that could be evolving [in] different ways.\"\n\nBrostrom told\
      \ CNN that her reaction made it clear that she would not consider the offer.\
      \ Sidib\xE9 told investigators he then agreed that they would \"leave the investigation\
      \ going.\"\n\nLoures told the inquiry that he neither wanted to \"apologize\"\
      \ nor meet with Sidib\xE9 and Brostrom, but rather wanted a \"full investigation,\"\
      \ because he believed it was in his interest.\n\nA spokesman for UNAIDS denied\
      \ that Sidib\xE9 offered Brostrom a promotion and reiterated that he had no\
      \ role in the outcome of the investigation.\n\nBy injecting himself into the\
      \ case, Sidib\xE9 had in effect become both witness to and judge of the investigation,\
      \ said Stephen Lewis, the former UNICEF worker. The inquiry would be given to\
      \ him to act upon, but he himself gave testimony to the independent investigators.\n\
      \n\"I mean, it's just nuts. How in god's name can you get an equitable outcome?\"\
      \ Lewis said.\n\nIn November 2017, Brostrom's lawyer wrote to Sidib\xE9 demanding\
      \ his recusal from the case. He did so shortly thereafter, delegating it to\
      \ a deputy.\n\nCareer ambitions\n\nMichel Sidib\xE9 \"was very, very worried\
      \ that the stuff around Luiz Loures would necessarily poison his prospects as\
      \ well as that of UNAIDS,\" said Lewis.\n\nA native of Mali, Sidib\xE9 had hoped\
      \ over the course of his career to be president of his country, or head of the\
      \ World Health Organization, or even secretary-general of the UN, the organization's\
      \ top job, two people who have known him for more than a decade told CNN.\n\n\
      \"None of those things have come to pass for whatever complement of reasons,\"\
      \ Lewis said. \"That's not conjecture -- he has confided that to me and to others\
      \ over the course of the years.\"\n\nDuring an internal staff meeting at the\
      \ end of February, Sidib\xE9 denied that he had been warned about Loures' behavior,\
      \ calling it \"total lying.\"\n\n\"Nobody came to tell me that,\" Sidib\xE9\
      \ said in the meeting, the audio of which was obtained by CNN.\n\nCNN spoke\
      \ to three separate people, including Lewis, who say they did exactly that.\
      \ One of them tells CNN the first warning came in July 2015, just two months\
      \ after the alleged assault against Martina Brostrom.\n\n\"The very first thing\
      \ I said to Michel was, 'Your deputy director is a sexual predator, and everybody\
      \ knows it,'\" said a former senior UNAIDS employee who spoke anonymously because\
      \ of their current position.\n\n\"He didn't even try to deny it.\"\n\nComplex\
      \ structure\n\nDiscussing this case, representatives of Guterres, the UN Secretary-General,\
      \ have cited a complex governance structure.\n\nGuterres is responsible for\
      \ appointing the head of UNAIDS, but the World Health Organization handles the\
      \ day-to-day administration of the organization, including this investigation.\
      \ WHO, though part of the UN system, operates independently; Sidib\xE9 and Loures\
      \ were named by Guterres' predecessor, Ban Ki-moon.\n\nWhen questioned at a\
      \ press briefing on February 6, the Secretary-General's deputy spokesman, Farhan\
      \ Haq, said that Guterres' office \"does not have jurisdiction over these cases.\"\
      \n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking in May 2017.\n\
      \nStill, Sidib\xE9 thought it worth mentioning at his staff meeting last month\
      \ -- after press reports about Loures began to appear in The Guardian and Foreign\
      \ Policy -- that Guterres had called him the previous weekend \"to give me his\
      \ full support.\"\n\nBrostrom provided CNN with four separate emails she sent\
      \ directly to Guterres, asking him to intervene in the case, starting in November\
      \ last year. She said she has not received any reply other than a confirmation\
      \ of receipt.\n\nHaq told CNN in a statement that Guterres has made it his \"\
      personal commitment\" to rid the UN of sexual harassment, and is working to\
      \ ensure that both staff and managers are aware of \"the protections and support\
      \ for victims and/or complainants, including protection against retaliation.\"\
      \n\nThe UN has launched a helpline \"to provide support and guidance for victims,\"\
      \ the statement said, and Guterres is \"committed to making it easier for people\
      \ to come forward.\"\n\nAt UNAIDS, Sidib\xE9 has announced plans to better identify,\
      \ document and take action against inappropriate behavior and abuse of authority.\
      \ UNAIDS said he is creating an external panel to provide recommendations on\
      \ sexual harassment.\n\n'Insufficient evidence'\n\nThe 14-month investigation\
      \ into Brostrom's allegations cleared Loures of wrongdoing.\n\nIt concluded\
      \ that while Brostrom's account was \"detailed,\" there was \"no evidence to\
      \ corroborate.\" Investigators said the hotel did not have closed-circuit TV\
      \ footage from the elevator.\n\nAnd the report said that while Loures' \"reported\
      \ behavior in kissing and engaging in physical contact with staff may be viewed\
      \ as inappropriate,\" there was \"insufficient evidence\" to back the claim\
      \ that he sexually harassed her.\n\nStill, in its concluding paragraph, the\
      \ head of the internal investigations department took the time to recommend\
      \ that \"as a preventative measure,\" senior managers remind Loures of the harassment\
      \ policy, \"especially with respect towards female colleagues.\"\n\nSidib\xE9\
      , in the internal staff meeting a month ago, lambasted those who speak publicly\
      \ about these allegations: \"Some people don't have ethics,\" he said.\n\nHe\
      \ said he wanted \"action\" to tackle the crisis, but also took some time to\
      \ praise Luiz Loures.\n\n\"He took the high road so UNAIDS could move on,\"\
      \ Sidib\xE9 said, and prevented the organization from being \"taken hostage\"\
      \ by the court of public opinion.\n\n\"I thank him for this courageous decision.\"\
      \n\nIn response to a CNN inquiry, Guterres' office said the Secretary-General\
      \ had spoken with Sidib\xE9 and other UN leaders and asked them to \"lead by\
      \ example.\"\n\n\"My dream job turned into a nightmare,\" Brostrom told Amanpour.\
      \ \"I have colleagues that stopped talking to me, friends that have turned their\
      \ backs on me, just because I have been speaking out what has happened.\"\n\n\
      She told Amanpour that she would love to return to the UN -- if the rules were\
      \ \"appropriately implemented\" -- because she considers the fight against HIV/AIDS\
      \ to be \"my calling.\"\n\nShe said she still believes in the UN mission --\
      \ \"today more than ever\" -- but that it must lead by example.\n\nIn her most\
      \ recent email to Guterres, Brostrom called herself \"the victim of a dual assault\
      \ -- first sexually by Luiz Loures and then professionally and morally by Michel\
      \ Sidib\xE9.\""

    text: '(CNN) Hillary Clinton hasn''t hit the campaign trail yet on behalf of Democrats
      running in 2018, but that isn''t stopping Republicans from using the former
      2016 Democratic presidential nominee as a reliable campaign boogeyman.


      In Pennsylvania''s special election earlier this month, a super PAC aligned
      with House Speaker Paul Ryan handed out door-hangers that featured Clinton and
      Nancy Pelosi to attack Democrat Conor Lamb.


      And over the past two weeks, Republicans have tried to tie vulnerable Democratic
      senators to comments Clinton made at a recent event in India that were seen
      as a knock at more conservative areas of the country, in which she said she
      "won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward." President
      Donald Trump, she said, ran a backward-looking campaign.


      The National Republican Senatorial Committee has cut digital ads featuring Clinton''s
      comments that target 10 Democratic senators running for reelection in states
      Trump won in 2016. The Republican challenger to one of those Democrats, Missouri
      Sen. Claire McCaskill, has also released digital ads tying McCaskill to Clinton
      and her comments.


      Clinton later explained in a Facebook post that she "meant no disrespect to
      any individual or group," but the political distancing and downright rebuking
      of her comments from red state Democrats came swiftly.


      "It wasn''t helpful. I thought it was wrong how she put it," McCaskill told
      MSNBC in an interview last weekend.


      "For those of us that are in states that Trump won," McCaskill added, "we would
      really appreciate if she would be more careful and show respect to every American
      voter and not just the ones who voted for her."


      When asked in a radio interview when she thought Clinton would exit the political
      landscape, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said, "Not soon enough."


      Democrats, especially those running in tough races in areas of the US that Trump
      won, aren''t necessarily eager to have Clinton as a surrogate.


      Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, in an exchange with the Tampa Bay Times this
      week, declined to answer whether he would campaign with Clinton as he seeks
      re-election this year.


      "Obviously when she was a candidate, I campaigned with her. That''s like you
      asking me would I campaign with Robert Redford. ... We''ll take that up when
      we get there," he said.


      One Democratic strategist working on a competitive 2018 Senate race said he''d
      rather have Trump visit the state for his candidate''s Republican opponent than
      Clinton visit to support his candidate.


      The strategist''s thinking: Clinton has never been a major draw at public events,
      so there''s limited upside. Trump, though, has embarrassed those he''s campaigned
      with -- particularly Alabama Republican Luther Strange -- by veering far off-topic
      and seemingly all but forgetting that the candidate is also on stage. Local
      coverage of a bombastic and unpopular President and footage of the two sharing
      the stage could actually help a Democratic candidate, this strategist argued.


      Even in the 23 Republican-held House seats that Clinton won in 2016, where she
      would arguably the most helpful, several other Democratic strategists said she''s
      not the most in-demand Democratic surrogate. Candidates, those strategists said,
      first ask for the Obamas -- Michelle, and then Barack.


      And former Vice President Joe Biden has effectively replaced Bill Clinton in
      the role of a Democrat who can campaign effectively in deep-red regions such
      as Alabama, where he boosted Doug Jones in December''s Senate special election,
      and Pennsylvania, where he backed Lamb.


      Clinton hasn''t yet scheduled any appearances for individual candidates in 2018.
      She''ll wait until closer to this summer to wade through the requests for appearances
      and fundraisers from candidates and Democratic groups, spokesman Nick Merrill
      said.


      Rather than play the role of campaign surrogate, aides say Clinton has carved
      out a position as a seed investor and strategic adviser of the anti-Trump resistance.


      On the advice of Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic National
      Committee chairman, she launched Onward Together, an organization with non-profit
      and political action committee arms, as the hub of her post-election activity.


      It''s designed to serve as an accelerator of sorts, injecting money and expertise
      into the new progressive groups that have proliferated since Trump''s election
      while also signaling to major donors that those groups have Clinton''s stamp
      of approval.


      Former campaign staffers Emmy Ruiz, Adam Parkhomenko and Nick Merrill are involved
      in the effort, as well as Dean and Clinton herself.


      In 2017, the group injected about $1 million into groups like Swing Left and
      Run for Something, all launched since Trump''s election.


      Clinton also made those staffers available as consultants for the organizations
      she backed.


      That, Merrill said, means anything from assisting with digital efforts to op-eds
      and fundraising.


      The main political event now on Clinton''s calendar, Merrill said, is a late-April
      gathering in New York of the Democratic groups that her political organization
      is backing. It''s being planned as days'' worth of working groups and introductions
      to donors, with Clinton playing a central role.


      Those progressive groups credit Clinton''s organization with helping them through
      their fraught early months.


      "They''ve been amazing. We wouldn''t have made it through the first year without
      their help," said Amanda Litman, the former Clinton campaign email director
      who became the co-founder of Run for Something, which helps young Democrats
      to run for office for the first time.


      She said a six-figure contribution from Clinton''s Onward Together came with
      no strings attached last year, allowing the group to quickly spend a "huge chunk"
      of it in Virginia state legislative races, "directly to candidates or funding
      canvasses or advertising."


      The behind-the-scenes maneuverings fit Clinton well, Litman said, particularly
      because she''s aware the 2018 battleground map, especially in the Senate, features
      competitive races in a number of states where she was trounced in 2016.


      "If a candidate or an org thinks something wouldn''t be helpful," Litman said,
      "she''s not going to do it just because of her ego or to be able to say ''I
      helped.'' She is not un-self aware about what implications her role has."'

    text: '(CNN) EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt''s 24-hour security in Washington
      extends to at least some of his personal trips, according to a letter Democratic
      Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse sent to the department''s inspector general and shared
      with CNN.


      The letter, written based on information that Whitehouse says he confidentially
      obtained from an unnamed source, raises new questions about the cost of Pruitt''s
      unprecedented EPA-funded security, and alleges that Pruitt has used his security
      detail while on non-official business, including trips home to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
      a family vacation to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl game.


      Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, says the new details should be added to the inspector
      general''s ongoing investigation into Pruitt''s travel expenses and use of a
      24/7 security detail. The documents, he wrote, raise concern "significant agency
      resources are being devoted to administrator Pruitt''s ''round-the-clock security,
      even when he is traveling on non-official business."


      Whitehouse adds, "While I consider matters of personal security to be extremely
      serious, personal security should never be used as a pretext to obtain special
      treatment."

      massacre, on Friday rejected an apology from Fox News host Laura Ingraham for
      her tweet mocking his college acceptance record.


      Asked by CNN''s Alisyn Camerota whether he accepts the apology from Ingraham
      , who tweeted to more than 2 million followers, Hogg said simply, "No."


      "She''s only apologizing after a third of her advertisers pulled out," the gun
      control activist continued, referencing the advertising boycott he called for
      after her tweet. As of Friday morning, seven advertisers had pulled out of Ingraham''s
      show, Camerota said on "New Day."


      "I think it''s great that corporate America is standing with me and the rest

      us, whether it be me or anybody else, you''re coming against all of us. And

      especially when all we''re trying to do here is save lives."


      Ingraham apologized Thursday in a tweet that also commended Hogg for his 4.2

    text: 'Washington (CNN) The success of the "Roseanne" reboot has thrilled President
      Donald Trump and his supporters.


      In the first episode of the revived series, real-life Trump supporter Roseanne
      Barr plays fictional Trump-supporter Roseanne Conner, who argues politics with
      her pussyhat-wearing sister. Barr''s character is a rarity, a pro-Trump character
      in a mainstream show that depicts a working-class family, and the ratings felt
      like a vindication for many who feel Hollywood does not represent them.


      More than 18 million people tuned in for the revived series'' debut Tuesday
      on ABC. Trump made a personal phone call to Barr and boasted about her ratings
      at his rally in Ohio Thursday. Ivanka Trump followed Barr on Twitter and Donald
      Trump Jr. tweeted his support for the show. Sarah Palin posted a photo with
      Barr on Instagram along with screenshots of Drudge Report headlines about it,
      and Sean Hannity invited Barr onto Fox News.

      There is undoubtedly a "celebrity gap" in politics that favors the left. Liberals
      have an army of actors, musicians, athletes and reality stars who are public
      and vocal about their politics, while conservatives do not have as many celebrity
      supporters. It showed at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Trump promised
      "showbiz" but was only able to deliver Willie Robertson from "Duck Dynasty"
      and Scott Baio from "Happy Days." And Trump''s inauguration lacked the megawatt
      star power of that of former President Barack Obama''s.


      While Trump has been dismissive of his inability to attract or impress A-listers
      from the entertainment world, his quick reaction when barometers of pop culture
      are in his favor suggest he appreciates it when he can. He''s tweeted about
      Jackie Evancho''s album sales after she was announced an inauguration performer
      and about the Oscars low ratings (poor awards show ratings being a favorite
      data point for conservatives, pointed to as proof their anti-Trump monologues
      are unpopular). And in his praise of "Roseanne" in Ohio, he suggested the mainstream
      media hadn''t "figured it out yet."

    text: 'Sol Flores looked at her newly minted campaign staff, recounting her story
      of sexual abuse as a child.


      Why didn''t you tell anyone, they wanted to know. Who was he? How long did this
      go on?


      "I was only 11," recalled Flores.


      It was odd to be speaking in such specific terms about the abuse, something
      that had defined her life and career as a social worker and advocate. She''d
      revealed it in general, but the details were hard to talk about.


      "It was 1984," said Flores, as she remembered the school art project that became
      a child''s first line of defense.


      Sol Flores says it''s time to change the face of Congress to better reflect
      the diversity in society.


      She decided to build a large wooden chest. Flores remembered how vividly she
      painted it -- purple and yellow with flowers. She could see them as she closed
      her eyes and talked.


      Flores would fill the chest at night with all the books and toys she had and
      lodge it against her door. While her mother worked at night, a man who was living
      with them would slip into her room and lift her clothes. The box would scrape
      against the carpet when he opened the door and startle Flores awake. At age
      11, Flores would bolt up and fight him off.


      That''s it, said Flores'' staff. That''s your opening campaign ad.


      Standing in the hallway of her childhood home, Flores, now a first-time Democratic
      candidate for Congress , stared into the camera and told voters of Illinois''
      4th congressional district about her abuse. She ends the ad with the rallying
      cry of the #MeToo movement: "I''ll fight as hard for you in Congress as I did
      to protect myself."


      I want voters to know I''ve been there. I''ve struggled just like them. I fought
      my way out. I will fight for them just as hard. Sol Flores, Democratic primary
      candidate for Illinois'' 4th congressional district


      From Chicago to Miami to Detroit, Democratic women running for state and federal
      office in 2018 tell CNN that the #MeToo movement is the rallying cry fueling
      their candidacies.


      What began as a hashtag generally against abusive men in power, moved into political
      accountability for alleged assaulters, and is now propelling some political
      candidacies in a historic year for women as record numbers run for local, state
      and national office in 2018.

      For progressive women now running as Democrats, the election of President Trump,
      who has denied accusations of sexual assault, was another spark and the Women''s
      Marches that followed his inauguration fanned the flames. They tell CNN they
      cast the President as both a symbol and perpetrator of the sexual harassment
      the #MeToo movement rallies against.


      Flores, executive director of La Casa Norte, a nonprofit organization that provides
      housing and services to homeless families in Chicago, said Trump''s election
      crystallized to her how little parity exists in the American political and power
      structure.


      The #MeToo movement, said Flores, is borne out of the frustration that power
      won''t shift unless government looks more like the people it''s supposed to
      represent. The Trump White House, said Flores, certainly bears little resemblance
      to Flores'' life or the life of her district.


      "We need to change the face of Congress," said Flores, running in an open seat
      created by the retirement of Rep. Luis Gutierrez.


      "I want voters to know I''ve been there. I''ve struggled just like them. I fought
      my way out. I will fight for them just as hard."


      Dana Nessel says not having enough women in positions of power contributes to
      the problem of sexual harassment.


      In Detroit, Democratic Michigan attorney general candidate Dana Nessel calls
      the #MeToo movement the singular, driving force for women candidates like her
      in 2018.


      "I think that''s a big part of why women are running for office. Because they
      know that part of ensuring that sexual harassment does not take place in the
      highest levels of government by making certain we have more women there."


      Nessel unapologetically and pointedly made #MeToo the centerpiece of her campaign.
      Nessel''s opening campaign ad was recorded in her living room on a shoestring
      budget, as she looks squarely into her phone camera.


      "When you''re choosing Michigan''s next attorney general, ask yourself this,"
      said Nessel. "Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional
      setting? Is it the candidate who doesn''t have a penis? I''d say so."


      To her surprise, the ad landed on Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel that night.
      Nessel has no regrets, she said.


      "I was making a serious point," said Nessel. "What considerably contributes
      to the problem of sexual harassment is when you don''t have enough women in
      positions of power."


      We''re fighting back against the notion that women are something that you can
      grope, you can abuse or harass, but not to be taken seriously. Dana Nessel,
      Democratic primary candidate for Michigan attorney general


      Nessel, a lawyer who has spent her career as a sex crimes prosecutor and civil
      rights defender, looks to the Trump White House as her "Exhibit A."


      "We view Donald Trump as potentially one of the worst offenders," said Nessel.
      "That sort of tone deafness, that complete lack of understanding of why that
      would be troublesome to the women who live in this country is exactly what we''re
      fighting against.


      "In November of 2018, we are going to see a cataclysmic push back to what we''ve
      seen through the Trump administration. We''re fighting back against the notion
      that women are something that you can grope, you can abuse or harass, but not
      to be taken seriously. We''re going to take back our state offices. We''re going
      to take back our federal offices and we''re not going to take it anymore."

      If there is anyone who pushing back directly and forcefully on Donald Trump,
      it''s Rachel Crooks. Less than one month before the 2016 presidential election,
      Crooks went public with an accusation directed at Trump. Crooks said that, more
      than a decade ago, she greeted Trump outside an elevator in Trump Tower. She
      was a receptionist in the building and says she was attempting to be cordial
      to one of her company''s business partners. Trump, she alleges, kissed her on
      the mouth and cheeks repeatedly for minutes without her consent. Last month,
      Crooks declared her candidacy to be a Democratic state representative in Ohio.


      Anita Hill stand to be sworn in to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee
      in October 1991.


      Political history has seen this before.


      In late 1991, the country was consumed with the confirmation hearings of Supreme
      Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Anita Hill, a former employee of Thomas, accused
      him of sexual harassment.


      "The visual that people saw on their television screens every day was a black
      woman, sitting alone, in front of a panel of 20 white, older men, who were being
      quite critical of her and her allegations against Clarence Thomas," said Assistant
      Professor Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics.
      "Many women at home saw that as a clear representation of their underrepresentation
      in Congress. That was a mobilizing force for many women to both encourage other
      women to run and to think about running for office themselves in that year."


      1992 became known as the Year of the Women, as a record number of women ran
      for office and made historic gains in Congress. 2018 mirrors 1992 in the number
      of women running for office, said Dittmar, fueled by a national conversation
      of inequity and sexual harassment as a result of the gender imbalance of power
      in government and business.


      She cautions that 2018 differs in that overall engagement by Democratic men
      and women is up but many of them are running against incumbents, so the final
      percentage gains in office may be lower than 1992.


      But the shift in the national and political conversation can''t be overstated,
      said Dittmar. "#MeToo allows both men and women, but particularly women, to
      say this issue has to be dealt with in public policy."


      Mary Barzee Flores, now a candidate for Congress, stands outside the Pizza Hut
      where she was attacked as a teen.


      "Hell yeah!" said Mary Barzee Flores, as she weighed whether to run for Congress.
      In Florida''s 27th congressional district, Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was
      retiring, making the diverse district a likely gain for Democrats. In a crowded
      field, Barzee Flores, a first time candidate, needed to introduce herself to
      voters. She chose to begin with an on-the-job assault by her manager when she
      was just 17 years old.


      Barzee Flores was working at a Pizza Hut near her home, a job she desperately
      needed in the months that followed her father''s sudden death. She had discovered
      the Pizza Hut manager''s wife was stealing money and reported the theft. When
      the woman was fired, Barzee Flores was promoted to the job formerly held by
      the wife of the manager.


      "One night he followed me into the walk-in cooler," Barzee Flores recounted
      to CNN. "He shut the door behind him and backed me into shelving. And I''ll
      never forget what he said. He said, ''If you''re going to take my wife''s place,
      you''re going to perform all her duties.''


      "He further backed me into the shelving. He lunged at me and groped me. I was
      terrified. Even if I screamed, no one would have heard me."


      (Trump''s election has) shaken us as women and made us stamp our collective
      feet and say, that''s it. This is ridiculous. Mary Barzee Flores, Democratic
      primary candidate for Florida''s 27th congressional district


      Barzee Flores says she doesn''t remember to this day exactly what she said or
      did, just that she pushed him and managed to get out of the cooler. She never
      told anyone, not even her brother who also worked at the Pizza Hut. Barzee Flores''
      brother would learn about the assault decades later.


      Barzee Flores, a lawyer, former public defender and judge calls Trump''s election
      a "shock."


      "This man in particular, the way he''s talked about women, the way he''s treated
      women, so crass and degrading. It''s shaken us as women and made us stamp our
      collective feet and say, that''s it. This is ridiculous. And that made me want
      to come forward and talk about this."


      Barzee Flores met with CNN outside the Pizza Hut where the teenage incident
      allegedly took place. She stresses her attack pales in comparison with many
      other more traumatic experiences women have faced, but says the assault has
      "informed me throughout my life," said Barzee Flores. "In my relationships,
      in my fight for the underdog, the under privileged and the disenfranchised as
      a public defender," she said. "It is still informing me."


      Barzee Flores turned and looked at the Pizza Hut. "I like to look at this and
      think about how far I''ve come. How important it is to fight for women, who
      like that 17-year-old kid in the walk-in cooler need to be fought for. And I
      think it gives me purpose."'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin isn''t
      going anywhere.


      In the hours since President Donald Trump fired Shulkin, announcing in a signature
      tweet that he planned to replace him with White House physician Ronny Jackson,
      the former secretary has waged a scorched earth campaign, sitting for a slew
      of TV interviews and penning a blistering New York Times op-ed in which he described
      the environment in Washington as so "toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive
      that it became impossible" for him to do his job.


      To hear Shulkin tell it, he was forced out of the White House amid a bitter
      policy dispute that hits right at the core of the agency''s mission: how to
      best care for the more than 9 million veterans who receive healthcare from VA.
      The inspector general report that faulted him and senior VA staffers for the
      handling of a summer trip to Europe? Just noise.


      Since the President announced on Wednesday that he was firing Shulkin -- a move
      that had been expected for weeks -- Shulkin has spoken with CNN, MSNBC, Fox
      News, NPR, and the PBS NewsHour, a highly unusual move for a departing cabinet
      secretary.


      He told MSNBC that he talked with the President the day that he was fired and
      that Trump made no mention of the fact that he would soon lose his job. (That
      message would be delivered later, in a phone call from White House chief of
      staff John Kelly.) He told NPR that his time at VA started strong but that "political
      appointees" in and outside the agency were trying to "undermine" his efforts
      to improve care for the nation''s veterans.

      he was an informal Trump campaign adviser in 2016 who was rumored last year
      to be a candidate for US ambassador to the European Union -- as part of special
      counsel Robert Mueller''s investigation, Malloch said.


      Malloch issued a written statement saying he was detained by the FBI on Tuesday
      after he arrived on an international flight to Boston, where federal investigators
      took his cell phone and questioned him about Republican operative Roger Stone
      and WikiLeaks. Malloch, who has authored a not-yet-published book accusing a
      so-called "deep state" within the US government of fabricating the opposition
      research dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia to try to destroy Trump,
      said he was served with a subpoena before he was released to appear before Mueller''s
      grand jury in Washington, which he''s expected to do next month.


      "The questions got more detailed about my involvement in the Trump campaign
      (which was informal and unpaid); whom I communicated with; whom I knew and how
      well -- they had a long list of names," Malloch said. "They seemed to then focus
      more attention on Roger Stone (whom I have met a grand total of three times
      and with groups of people); Jerome Corsi, a journalist who edited a memoir I
      had written some years ago; and about WikiLeaks, which I knew nothing."


      He said was asked specifically if he had visited the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,
      where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been holed up for nearly six years.
      He had not, he said.


      Malloch''s statement shines another light into the workings of Mueller''s probe
      into potential collusion between Trump''s campaign team and Russia, which has
      also investigated potential financial crimes and other matters.'

      in a presidential proclamation on Friday.


      The proclamation states that during the month of April, the United States will
      emphasize the need "to provide opportunities for people with criminal records
      to earn an honest second chance."


      A bipartisan group of senators, including Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois
      and Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, introduced a resolution last year to
      make April 2017 "Second Chance Month" to honor efforts to help those with criminal
      records become productive members of society. The Senate passed the resolution
      in April of last year. A similar resolution was introduced by Democratic Rep.
      Tony Cardenas of California last week.


      "Affording those who have been held accountable for their crimes an opportunity
      to become contributing members of society is a critical element of criminal
      justice that can reduce our crime rates and prison populations, decrease burdens
      to the American taxpayer, and make America safer," Trump said in his proclamation.


      The President goes on to urge the implementation of "evidence-based programs"
      in prison systems at the federal, state and local level that focus on job training,
      mentoring and treatment for drug and mental health issues.

      despite their questionable backgrounds, The Washington Post reported Friday.


      Despite the need to fill the administration''s posts, the Office of Presidential
      Personnel, which recruits candidates to serve the President in the executive
      branch and oversees the selection of presidential appointments, also became
      a social hub, the Post reported, citing current and former White House officials.


      White House officials confirmed to the newspaper that PPO leaders held happy
      hours in their offices that included beer, wine and snacks for office employees
      and White House liaisons in federal agencies. Officials in the office also played
      a drinking game called "Icing" to celebrate the deputy director''s 30th birthday,
      the Post reported. "Icing involves hiding a bottle of Smirnoff Ice, a flavored
      malt liquor, and demanding that the person who discovers it, in this case the
      deputy director, guzzle it," the newspaper reported.


      The White House confirmed to the Post that office officials played the drinking
      game, but said it and the happy hours are not unique to that office and allow
      staff to network and let off steam.


      The revelations about the office come as the administration has struggled to
      fill positions and has suffered from high turnover. White House officials acknowledged
      to the Post that "some PPO staff got their jobs in part as thanks for working
      on the Trump campaign," the newspaper reported. The Post added that some of
      those aides had backgrounds that were unusual for their jobs.

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Senior White House aides are exasperated with Environmental
      Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, the already embattled Cabinet
      secretary who now finds himself at the center of an expanding controversy over
      his decision to rent a room in Washington, DC, from the family of an energy
      lobbyist.


      The White House has yet to officially comment on Pruitt''s standing, but a government
      official tells CNN that the lack of responsiveness shows they are not ready
      to step in and defend Pruitt, who they believe has created a series of headaches
      for an administration looking to move past controversies involving Cabinet secretaries.


      A White House official said the source of the frustration stems from the fact
      that White House officials began learning about this issue from media reports,
      not Pruitt himself, an issue that officials have complained about in the past
      over controversies involving Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson
      and recently-fired Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin


      Pruitt rented a room in a condo from Vicki and Steven Hart, lobbyists whose
      firm has lobbied the EPA on behalf of an Oklahoma Energy company, ABC News and
      Bloomberg reported. According to Bloomberg, Pruitt leased a room for around
      $50 a night, only paying when he stayed there. In total, Pruitt paid $6,100
      for the room over six months, a rate significantly lower than market value.


      CNN has confirmed Pruitt''s landlords, the Harts, were political donors of his
      when he was an Oklahoma state official. According to campaign finance records,
      Steven Hart hosted a "fundraising reception" for Pruitt''s 2014 campaign for
      Oklahoma attorney general. The contribution report filed with the Oklahoma Ethics
      Commission states that Hart spent $1,616.43 on the expense.


      In addition, Hart and his wife Vicki made a $500 contribution to Pruitt in October
      2010, a $1,000 contribution to Pruitt in September 2011 and a $250 contribution
      to Pruitt in April 2012.


      "It''s not good," one of the sources said bluntly when asked about Pruitt.


      An EPA source was even more dour on Pruitt''s standing.


      "People are freaking out" over the volume of negative stories about Pruitt,
      the source said about the feeling inside the agency. The source wasn''t even
      sure if the former attorney general of Oklahoma could survive the controversy.


      Pruitt''s "goose is cooked," the source said.


      The White House did not respond for comment for this report.


      One possible reason for the doubt over his future is the fact that Pruitt has
      found himself in trouble for months because of the 24-hour security that the
      EPA administrator has required and his use of first-class travel. On Friday,
      CNN reported that Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse obtained information from
      a confidential, unnamed source that he says indicates Pruitt''s extensive EPA-funded
      security included non-official business, like trips home to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
      a family vacation to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl game.


      Pruitt was one of four Cabinet secretaries to be called to the White House last
      month to be scolded for a series of embarrassing stories about questionable
      ethical behavior. During the meetings, according to a source, chief of staff
      John Kelly made clear that "optics matter" and White House officials urged agencies
      to flag any possible problems before they appear in the media.


      Pruitt, according to a source familiar with the arrangement, leased the room
      in the Capitol Hill condo at 223 C Street NE from the lobbyist couple. The condo
      is owned by an LLC that shares a business address with Vicki Hart''s lobbying
      firm and property records show that Hart purchased the condo.

      Hart is a health care lobbyist who runs Hart Health Strategies Inc. Lobbying
      disclosures do not show that she did any lobbying at the EPA, but Hart''s husband,
      J. Steven Hart, has lobbied the EPA on behalf of glass bottle manufacturer,
      Owens-Illinois, Inc. He has worked with the bottling company since 2009.


      At some point, the EPA source told CNN, Pruitt''s relationship with the Harts
      soured and one of the landlords called the administrator''s chief of staff to
      complain. "He''s destroying my hardwood floors," Pruitt''s chief of staff was
      told, the source said.


      An EPA official with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN the ethics counsel
      had reviewed Pruitt''s living arrangement. It was not considered an ethics issue
      because Pruitt paid rent. "It was not a gift because he paid value for it,"
      the official said. In addition, the landlord was a friend of Pruitt''s, and
      the law "does not ban federal employees from receiving a gift from a friend."


      "As EPA career ethics officials stated in a memo, Administrator Pruitt''s housing
      arrangement for both himself and family was not a gift and the lease was consistent
      with federal ethics regulations," agency spokesman Jahan Wilcox said Friday
      evening.


      Pruitt''s agreement with the Harts is also drawing attention from Capitol Hill,
      with at least one Democrat already calling for the EPA administrator to resign.


      "Pruitt''s secret rent deal with a lobbyist for companies regulated by the EPA
      is much like his many other scandals," Rep. Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat,
      tweeted on Friday. "Pruitt must resign. If he refuses to do so he should be
      fired immediately."'

    text: '(CNN) Long before Donald Trump declared his presidential candidacy, conservative
      strategist Steve Bannon sought to leverage data-driven technology to push the
      hearts and minds of voters toward his populist vision for America.


      Former Cambridge Analytica staffers tell CNN that Bannon''s vision came to fruition
      through their previous employer, which they described as a weapon of psychological
      warfare. They say that Cambridge Analytica''s parent company had worked on government
      and military contracts that aimed to change foreign populations'' behaviors,
      which aligned with Bannon''s intentions.


      Two former employees said that Bannon was personally involved in the company''s
      early stages and that he played a direct role shaping its strategy and goals.


      "This was Steve Bannon''s baby," said former contractor Christopher Wylie, who
      described Cambridge Analytica as "Bannon''s arsenal of weaponry to wage a culture
      war on America using military strategies."


      Bannon wanted to use the sorts of aggressive messaging tactics usually reserved
      for geopolitical conflicts to move the US electorate further to the right, Wylie
      said. He had already directed a series of anti-establishment, conservative documentary
      films and presided over the far-right website Breitbart News, but Cambridge
      Analytica would mark another step in his overall ambitions to transform the
      nation.


      With financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, Bannon co-founded
      Cambridge Analytica in 2013 as the US-branch of Strategic Communication Laboratories
      (SCL) Group, a British company that advertises how it has conducted "behavioral
      change" programs in more than 60 countries.


      Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as "Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer using
      a foreign, military contractor ... to use some of the same techniques that the
      military uses ... on the American electorate."


      Bannon and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment to this
      story.


      SCL Group has consulted numerous government agencies and organizations on psychological
      operations and strategic messaging since the 1990s. The company has offered
      clients "research and analysis that yields intervention strategies aimed at
      specific behaviors," according to its website


      That work has included an examination of ways to reduce recruitment into violent
      jihadist groups in Pakistan in 2009, a communication program aimed at decreasing
      the number of improvised explosive devices built in Iraq, as well as political
      consulting throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and South America,
      according to SCL documents.


      SCL was commissioned to train a psychological operations group that supported
      the British military, according to a 2012 letter by the group''s then-commanding
      officer.


      The US State Department also contracted SCL in 2017 to conduct "target audience
      research" in order to better understand ISIS radicalization and recruitment.
      A State Department official told CNN the research included about 100 interviews
      in Europe and the Middle East.


      "SCL''s sales pitch essentially was ''Look, we go into foreign countries. We
      use our tools, our psychographic profiling, to manipulate public opinion.''
      Ultimately that''s what Bannon wanted to do in the United States," said CNN
      political analyst Joshua Green, whose book ''Devil''s Bargain'' chronicles Bannon''s
      role in Trump''s election.


      Cambridge Analytica has come under fire this month for its alleged use of personal
      data from tens of millions of Facebook users obtained through the company Global
      Science Research (GSR) without Facebook''s permission. The New York Times and
      The Observer of London first broke the story.


      Bannon, a former White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO, told CNN
      last week that he doesn''t remember purchasing personal information from Facebook
      while working for the company.


      He has said that Democrats have been leveraging social media data for campaign
      messaging for years but have received little scrutiny. He also said that SCL
      is separate from Cambridge Analytica and that the company''s "psychographics,"
      referring to personality profiles used to try to predict people''s interest,
      values, and opinions, were not used during the Trump campaign.


      "Cambridge Analytica is the data scientists and the applied applications here
      in the United States. It has nothing to do with the international stuff," Bannon
      said at the Financial Times "Future of News" event last week.


      But four former SCL and Cambridge Analytica employees said the two companies
      were basically one and the same, sharing resources, holding joint meetings and
      using similar methodologies.


      "SCL and Cambridge were completely joined at the hip. There is no difference
      between the two," said one former Cambridge Analytica employee who spoke to
      CNN on the condition of anonymity citing fear of retribution.


      Wylie said that Bannon''s plans began to solidify in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica
      consulted various Republican campaigns and PACs ahead of the midterm elections.
      The company began to test and apply its psychographics by using Facebook data
      to model individuals'' personality types in order to understand how to influence
      them.


      Documents show the John Bolton Super PAC, which promoted candidates supported
      by recently appointed White House national security adviser John Bolton, paid
      Cambridge Analytical $454,700 in 2014 for "behavioral microtargeting with psychographic
      messaging." Those services included strategies that broke individual voters
      into "clusters" based on what messages would resonate with them.


      Wylie also said the company used focus groups and messaging trials in 2014 to
      test some of the concepts that became core themes of the Trump campaign, such
      as "drain the swamp" and imagery of walls.


      "A lot of the narratives of the Trump campaign were what we were testing in
      2014," Wylie said.


      He added that Bannon directly presided over much of the company''s initial research.


      "Everything that we were doing ultimately had to be passed up to Bannon for
      approval," said Wylie, who left the company in late 2014.


      Wylie said Bannon would fly to London about once a month for company meetings,
      and during that time he came to understand Bannon''s ideology.


      "He really liked the idea of using a military-style approach to changing people''s
      perceptions," Wylie said.


      Although Cambridge Analytica worked to sharpen its psychographic techniques
      ahead of the presidential election, former Trump campaign staffers have told
      CNN they did not buy into those methodologies when the company began consulting
      for the campaign in the summer of 2016.


      Cambridge Analytica said in statement it did not use Facebook data obtained
      from GSR during the 2016 presidential election but rather relied on voter files
      from the Republican National Committee, campaign donor information and other
      consumer data for its operation.


      At a post-election event hosted by Google in December 2016, Cambridge Analytica''s
      then-head of product Matt Oczkowski said the pace of the Trump campaign led
      his company to rely less on personality profiling and instead focus on traditional
      data services.


      "We didn''t really use psychographics that much because we had to walk before
      we could run," Oczkowski said.


      Some political consultants and researchers say that despite the attraction of
      being able to sway voters through messaging based on personality data, the actual
      effectiveness of psychographics remains questionable.


      "Cambridge Analytica''s approach is massively overhyped just because the word
      ''psych'' is in it. There''s no compelling scientific evidence that the approach
      they''re taking is in any part effective," said David Rand, a Yale professor
      of psychology and economics, who studies human behavior.


      Whether or not Cambridge Analytica played a significant role in influencing
      voters or sealing Trump''s victory, Wylie says Bannon''s dream became a reality.


      "He sees this as warfare, so he is going to use as aggressive of techniques
      as he can get away with," Wylie said.'

    text: '(CNN) When a dark green train adorned with yellow stripes was spotted traveling
      toward Beijing on Monday, rumors began to swirl that North Korean leader Kim
      Jong Un was on board.


      Those rumors were later confirmed and pictures began to emerge showing Kim on
      his first foreign trip since assuming power in 2011 , meeting with China''s
      President Xi Jinping and other high-level Chinese officials.


      North Korea''s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) has now published
      footage revealing new details of the historic trip.


      The train -- which appears to be the same one used by Kim''s father and grandfather
      -- made its first stop Sunday in China at Dandong, a city close to the border
      and around 840 kilometers (520 miles) from Beijing by road.


      Kim''s wife Ri Sol Ju is shown holding a bouquet of flowers given to her husband
      on their arrival in Dandong.


      A group of Chinese officials met the train at Dandong and boarded one of the
      carriages to greet Kim, who was seen smiling and posing for the cameras as he
      was handed a bouquet of flowers, which were then passed to his wife Ri Sol Ju.


      Along with Kim and his wife, the North Korean delegation included leading members
      of the Workers'' Party of Korea Central Committee.


      The Chinese officials who boarded the train included China''s ambassador to
      North Korea, Li Jinjun, and the head of the International Liaison Department
      of the Communist Party''s Central Committee, Song Tao, according to KCNA.


      Chinese officials hold a meeting with Kim on the train at Dandong.


      Chinese envoy Song Tao led the delegation that met Kim at Dandong.


      Seated in two rows of pink couches on either side of the train carriage, Kim
      opposite Tao, the two groups held talks.


      Three members of the Chinese delegation -- including Tao and Jinjun -- stayed
      on the train and traveled with Kim on the next leg of his journey, to Beijing,
      according to KCNA.


      As the train departed Dandong, the footage shows the other Chinese officials
      who stayed behind waving to Kim -- and Kim waving back.

      Arriving in Beijing on Tuesday, Kim was welcomed by the Chinese military and
      a red carpet. More bouquets awaited the leader and his wife as they alighted
      from the train and were met by officials from the ruling Communist Party of
      China, the footage shows.


      Cameras flashed and the military stood to attention as Kim and his wife led
      the delegation down a platform adorned with a red carpet.


      Kim gets a ceremonial welcome at Beijing train station.


      The next day, Kim boarded the green train once again, this time for the return
      journey. After a final onboard sendoff from Tao and members of the Beijing welcome
      delegation, Kim, standing next to his wife, smiled and waved out of the window.
      The footage shows Chinese officials on the platform waving goodbye.


      Kim Jong Un waves during his sendoff from Beijing station Tuesday.


      According to a 2009 report in South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo , the train
      used by Kim''s father, Kim Jong II -- which appears to be the same one used
      for this trip -- had 90 carriages and was so heavily armored that it traveled
      at an average speed of 60 kilometers an hour (about 37 mph).


      It contained conference rooms, an audience chamber and bedrooms and featured
      satellite phone connections and flat screen televisions, the paper reported.


      Kim Jong Un''s father, Kim Jong Il, is greeted by women in traditional costume
      as he arrives in Omsk, Russia in 2001.


      New York Times report from 2002 said that memoirs by former Russian official
      Konstantin Pulikovsky purportedly claimed that Kim Jong Il had his train conducted
      by beautiful women and loaded with extravagant dishes and wine.


      ''''It was possible to order any dish of Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese
      and French cuisine,'''' Pulikovsky wrote, according to the report.


      His account drew largely on a report that was supposed to be confidential by
      a note taker from the Russian Foreign Ministry, who was on board during Kim
      Jong Il''s one-month ride across Russia in 2001, according to the Times.


      Live lobsters were taken to train stations along the route, Pulikovsky wrote
      in his memoirs, and cases of Bordeaux and Burgundy red wines were reportedly
      delivered, too.


      CNN could not independently verify the Times account or the South Korean report
      detailing the Kim family train.


      Before this week, the most recent international train trip reported was in August
      2011, months before the elder Kim''s death, when he visited Moscow to meet with
      then-President Dmitry Medvedev.'

      too often evade accountability. These heinous crimes are committed indiscriminately:
      in intimate relationships, in public spaces, and in the workplace," the presidential
      proclamation from the White House states.


      Over the past year, there has been a reckoning in the United States over sexual
      assault and harassment, particularly in the workplace, known as the #MeToo movement.


      Revelations surrounding various industry leaders accused of sexual assault and
      harassment in recent months also come as Trump himself has been accused of sexual
      misconduct by a number of women.

    text: '(CNN) The day after a CNN interview with a former Playboy model who claims
      to have had a 10-month affair with her husband, first lady Melania Trump opted
      to leave President Donald Trump alone for the ride from the White House to Andrews
      Air Force Base.


      The official White House schedule, released Thursday evening, stated the first
      couple would depart the White House together aboard Marine One en route to Joint
      Base Andrews, but Mrs. Trump did not appear beside her husband. CNN reached
      out to the first lady''s communications office for an explanation or comment
      on the change in plan but did not receive a response.


      On Monday, the first couple walked together across the South Lawn to Marine
      One, and then on to New Hampshire. A brief trip on the grass made for a moment
      between husband and wife, as Trump, with his arm around his wife''s waist, caught
      Mrs. Trump as she fell -- in return, she placed her arm around him.


      However, on Friday, no such public display of affection. This week has been
      a busy one for the first lady, who gave remarks about the opioid crisis in New
      Hampshire as well as met with representatives from the internet to discuss kids
      and social media at the White House on Tuesday. Just this afternoon she delivered
      a speech at the State Department as part of the International Women of Courage
      awards'' ceremony.


      On February 16, the day news first broke about Karen McDougal''s alleged affair,
      Mrs. Trump took a previously unscheduled separate motorcade to Joint Base Andrews
      in the same manner as today.

    text: "(CNN) President Donald Trump is facing cresting challenges at home and\
      \ overseas by rejecting traditional West Wing structures and defying an orthodox\
      \ policy process while stacking his administration with subordinates who share\
      \ his combative reflexes.\n\nA month of turmoil, staff purges and sharp policy\
      \ shifts by a President determined more than ever to follow his impulses has\
      \ left the White House at a perilous moment of global transition.\n\nIn becoming\
      \ true to his outsider anti-establishment roots, the President is implementing\
      \ the purest form of Trumpism he has so far attempted.\n\nYet his experiment\
      \ with gut-level governance brings significant risks of unpredictable results,\
      \ ahead of tests like his summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un or work\
      \ to create a post-ISIS settlement in Syria.\n\nAs he conducts his symphony\
      \ of chaos at home, the President has lost seven people from within his administration\
      \ or inner circle in just a month, some of whom were fired by tweet.\n\nHe has\
      \ swapped restraining influences like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or traditionalists\
      \ like national security advisor H.R. McMaster with replacements such as Mike\
      \ Pompeo and John Bolton who reflect his own aggressive instincts or who lavished\
      \ him with praise on TV.\n\nBut it is his tendency to make policy on an ad hoc\
      \ basis, on issues on which millions of lives could depend, that may represent\
      \ Trump's most significant turn.\n\nFor example, on Thursday, Trump declared\
      \ that the US will be coming out of Syria \"real soon,\" sparking a day of scrambling\
      \ and contradictions from within his own national security team.\n\n\"We are\
      \ still trying to figure out what he meant about Syria yesterday,\" a senior\
      \ administration official told CNN's Jim Acosta on Friday.\n\nThe episode was\
      \ an apt metaphor for Trump's governing style. Normally, a President would only\
      \ make such pronouncements after weeks of briefings and meetings, after poring\
      \ over policy papers providing an in-depth understanding of the battlefield\
      \ and a set of options on a tough issue.\n\nBut with Trump, the process is reversed\
      \ -- instinct and impulse power his actions, after little apparent forethought\
      \ or assessment of the unpalatable consequences that usually accompany any serious\
      \ presidential decision.\n\nHis disruptive tendency was visible again on Sunday,\
      \ when many Americans were observing Easter or Passover, festivals of renewal\
      \ and liberation. Trump went on a Twitter tear, accusing Mexico of failing to\
      \ stop undocumented migrants from crossing the southern US border and warned\
      \ he could kill a NAFTA renegotiation if it didn't do more.\n\nReflexive decisions\n\
      \nIt is a pattern that has been repeated over and over in recent weeks, from\
      \ Trump's sudden reflex decision to meet one-on-one with Kim, to his demand\
      \ for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that rocked US allies.\n\nIn each\
      \ case, Trump's sudden move set his aides struggling to keep up and understand\
      \ his strategy, such as it was. It is also a style of governing that sets nerves\
      \ on edge back home and brings with it considerable risks, however true it may\
      \ be to Trump's vow as a candidate to keep everyone guessing.\n\nTrump's sudden\
      \ nomination last week of his personal White House physician Ronny Jackson to\
      \ head the Veterans Affairs department fitted the trend -- showing a President\
      \ more interested in shock and awe news and affinity with a nominee than concern\
      \ for in-depth policy.\n\nJackson may have impressed Trump with his bravura\
      \ news conference on the President's health -- and is loved among many current\
      \ and former White House officials -- but he has no experience running a major\
      \ organization and the VA is one of the most expansive and troubled medical\
      \ bureaucracies in the world.\n\nThe hollowing out of Trump's political circle\
      \ is mirrored in his legal war council, following the recent departure of his\
      \ counsel John Dowd and a struggle to attract blue chip counsel to strengthen\
      \ his team.\n\nAs Robert Mueller bores ever deeper into his business and political\
      \ affairs, Trump's apparent desire to testify personally to the special counsel\
      \ reflects his trust in his own instincts and impatience for advice despite\
      \ the risks, mirroring his new approach to domestic and international policy.\n\
      \nAnd those who fear that the President's moods and hubris are increasingly\
      \ driving his actions are worried the departure of one of his most trusted friends\
      \ and aides, Hope Hicks, could make him even more volatile.\n\nProgrammer in\
      \ chief\n\nThe circus surrounding Trump has often been compared to a reality\
      \ show.\n\nBut increasingly, the administration actually resembles a cable politics\
      \ channel, with Trump as chief programmer and anchor, making news, breaking\
      \ it and ditching a traditional policy process for a corps of conservative commentators.\n\
      \nBolton spent months auditioning for his new role on Fox News. And his new\
      \ top economic advisor Larry Kudlow has been an outspoken CNBC voice for years.\n\
      \nSuch spectacle infuriates critics who see government as a serious business,\
      \ fraught with risks and defined by processes tested by generations of bureaucrats\
      \ and West Wing tradition.\n\nBut there is a gulf between the political class\
      \ in Washington and Trump supporters.\n\n\"This whole idea that President Trump\
      \ is somehow chaotic and unique because he has his own strong point of view\
      \ and is trying to push his administration in the way he sees fit, is actually\
      \ the way presidents operate in the job,\" Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the\
      \ American Conservative Union, told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nWith the economy\
      \ roaring, with unemployment below 5%, after the passage of a huge tax cut and\
      \ with his Cabinet lieutenants dismantling Obama-era regulations despite scandals\
      \ swirling around them, Trump's base is remaining solid, giving him latitude\
      \ for his currently unorthodox approach.\n\nTrump showed how well he understands\
      \ this during a rally in Ohio on Thursday, embracing a revival of ABC's \"Roseanne\"\
      \ -- claiming the show's success is rooted in giving voice to white, working-class\
      \ families who power his movement.\n\n\"It was about us. They haven't figured\
      \ it out, the fake news hasn't quite figured it out yet,\" Trump said during\
      \ a speech in Ohio.\n\nYet the increasingly improvisational and unpredictable\
      \ approach that worked for Trump as candidate and is coming to define the administration\
      \ faces an examination at a time when Washington chaos could exert a heavy price.\n\
      \nSo far, Trump has been spared a major foreign policy crisis or an economic\
      \ meltdown that puts his capacity to lead with coherence, speed, organization\
      \ and in a way that foments national unity on the line.\n\nBut history, from\
      \ the Cuban Missile Crisis to the more recent financial meltdown has shown that\
      \ sometimes only decisive presidential leadership, rooted in policy mastery,\
      \ cool-headedness and an ability to command a functioning US government and\
      \ national resources can stave off disaster.\n\nA global economic shock, a massive\
      \ natural disaster, a mass casualty terror attack, a sudden crisis with China\
      \ or a further deterioration in post-Cold War relations with Russia could trigger\
      \ such a moment.\n\nTrump has rarely shown so far he would be up to such a task.\n\
      \nFor instance, there's no indication yet that he has a clear strategy for his\
      \ talks with Kim \u2014 the most high-stakes meeting between a US President\
      \ and a foreign leader for decades. The cost of a failed summit could spark\
      \ a slide into a disastrous war that could kill hundreds of thousands.\n\nTrump's\
      \ reflexive warning that the US will soon leave Syria, would in theory boost\
      \ US adversaries in the region including Russia and Iran, and open the kind\
      \ of vacuum that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq, if it was carried out.\n\n\
      Re-writing the rules\n\nSome Washington veterans believe that Trump's scattergun\
      \ approach is certain to undermine his presidency in the long term -- even though\
      \ he has prospered by rewriting all the rules of campaigning.\n\n\"To be successful\
      \ in politics over the long term when you are governing you have to have a strategy\
      \ and an agenda, and you have to go out and build on it day after day after\
      \ day. What Trump does is he just tries to build interest rather than building\
      \ a message over a long term,\" said Joe Lockhart, a former White House spokesman\
      \ for Bill Clinton.\n\n\"It seems chaotic, he loves that. I don't think that\
      \ sets him up though for the long-term and re-election, I don't think he really\
      \ understands how different 2020 will be from 2016,\" Lockhart told CNN's Ana\
      \ Cabrera on Friday.\n\nTrump's governing style, in which he is the dominant\
      \ figure, dictating events, making calls from the gut, surrounded by acolytes\
      \ and family members, recalls the small leadership cell at the top of the Trump\
      \ organization.\n\nIndeed, friends of the President are telling him that he\
      \ doesn't need to replace Hicks as communications director or John Kelly as\
      \ chief of staff if he eventually decides to leave or is fired, CNN's Kevin\
      \ Liptak reported last week.\n\nYet such fluid structures have been tried before\
      \ and have failed, notably in the Carter and Ford presidencies when they became\
      \ overwhelmed by the crush of events and issues bearing down on the West Wing.\n\
      \n\"You just can't run the White House the way you run the 26th floor of Trump\
      \ Tower,\" Chris Whipple, author of \"The Gatekeepers\" a book that maintains\
      \ that strong White House chiefs of staff are vital to a functioning presidency,\
      \ told CNN on Saturday."

    text: 'China is showing the United States that it will make good on its trade
      threats.


      The Chinese government said that tariffs on about $3 billion worth of US imports
      are going into effect Monday, hitting 128 products ranging from pork to steel
      pipes.


      It''s the latest move in escalating tensions between the world''s two largest
      economies, which some experts fear could turn into a trade war.


      Beijing says the new sanctions on 128 US products, which it first proposed 10
      days ago, are in response to President Donald Trump''s tariffs on imports of
      steel and aluminum from China and some other countries.


      But Trump also has more measures in the works aimed specifically at China. He
      has announced plans to slap tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods
      following an investigation by his administration into the theft of intellectual
      property from US companies.


      Related: The world is on the brink of a trade war


      It''s unclear how China will respond to those aggressive measures. The Trump
      administration hasn''t yet detailed which Chinese products will be affected.
      For now, Beijing is focusing on its response to the steel and aluminum tariffs.


      China''s commerce and finance ministries said in statements late Sunday that
      authorities are imposing tariffs of 15% on 120 American products -- such as
      fruits, nuts, wine and steel pipes -- and 25% on eight other products, including
      pork and recycled aluminum.


      Those products make up just a tiny portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars
      of goods shipped between the two countries each year. But the tariffs are alarming
      news for the affected industries.


      The US National Pork Producers Council warned last month that the measures would
      "have a significant negative impact on rural America." It said the US pork industry
      sold $1.1 billion worth of products to China last year, making it the third
      largest export market.


      China is upset that Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs on the grounds
      of national security, which Beijing says is an abuse of global trade rules.


      Since first announcing the metal tariffs, the White House has said it will spare
      a number of allies from the measures, including Canada, Mexico, the European
      Union and South Korea.


      China''s Ministry of Commerce said in its statement late Sunday that those exemptions
      "seriously violate" World Trade Organization rules that prohibit members from
      discriminating against other WTO members.


      It said it hoped the US government would withdraw the tariffs "as soon as possible
      so that the trading of products between China and the United States will return
      to a normal track."


      Related: What happens when the world''s two biggest economies turn on each other


      China has repeatedly said that it doesn''t want a trade war but has also warned
      that it will take "firm and necessary" countermeasures to defend its interests.


      In an opinion article Monday, China''s official news agency Xinhua warned that
      Trump''s plans to impose further trade measures on China are a "self-defeating
      gamble" that will cause harm to the American economy.


      "Trump''s planned tariffs are not only going to hamper the United States'' economic
      well-being and continued progress, and burden its people with higher costs of
      living, but also pose a grave threat to the current global trading system,"
      the article said.


      Trump has long accused Beijing of stealing American jobs through unfair trade
      practices. He has promised to bring down the United States'' huge trade deficit
      in goods with China, which reached $375 billion last year. But economists have
      cautioned that tariffs are unlikely to achieve that goal and risk hurting economic
      growth instead.


      Related: Tariffs, Trump and trade wars: Here''s what it all means


      Top US and Chinese officials have been holding talks in an effort to stop the
      trade tensions from spiraling out of control. But so far, neither side is backing
      down.


      Experts say they expect further retaliation from China once the Trump administration
      reveals more details on which products its planned $50 billion in tariffs will
      target.


      Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner at economic research firm Gavekal, predicted
      in a note to clients late last month that the next round of Chinese measures
      will focus on US agricultural exports from predominantly Trump-voting states.


      China''s approach is to show it''s willing to stand up to the United States
      but without going as far as seriously disrupting the global trading system,
      according to Kroeber.


      China wants "to position itself as the good guy in the global economy, protecting
      the rules of the game from Trump''s lawless attacks," he wrote.

      on purchases from Amazon, the company now facing his ire amid claims it doesn''t
      pay its fair share of shipping costs and taxes.


      A report by CBS News digging into Federal Election Commission records found
      that in 2015 and 2016 the campaign spent $158,498.41 in 379 transactions classified
      as office supply purchases. The committee continued after the election to spend
      money on the website, purchasing more than $2000 in 2017.


      Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon and the Washington Post, both of which
      are owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos.


      "While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will
      lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts
      to Billions of Dollars," Trump tweeted Saturday morning.


      "The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ''the size of the company''s lobbying staff
      has ballooned,'' and that......does not include the Fake Washington Post, which
      is used as a ''lobbyist'' and should so REGISTER," the President wrote. "If

      $2.6 Billion.''"

      \ and Economic Policy. And it also does not collect sales taxes on purchases\
      \ made on Amazon from third-party vendors. Third-party vendors had sales of\
      \ $32 billion on Amazon in 2017, although some of those sales were outside of\
      \ North America.\n\n2. Postal Service\n\nAmazon pays the post office to deliver\
      \ packages to customers' doors.\n\nBecause Amazon ships so many packages though\
      \ the post office, it pays a lower rate than most customers. But Amazon doesn't\
      \ get a special rate \u2014 it pays the rate that the post office charges other\
      \ bulk shippers.\n\nAmazon also has a special agreement with the Postal Service\
      \ to deliver packages on Sundays. Neither Amazon nor the post office has disclosed\
      \ the details of its agreement, but the Postal Service says it's mutually beneficial.\
      \ Amazon effectively helps the Postal Service spread its costs over a seven-day\
      \ week.\n\nThe Postal Service is losing money. But it's not Amazon's fault:\
      \ Citigroup last year reported that the average parcel rate would need to increase\
      \ by about 50% for the Postal Service to break even. The Postal Service's biggest\
      \ money problem is that it has billions in retirement obligations to its workers\
      \ that it can't afford.\n\n3. Retail\n\nStrong currents are pushing traditional\
      \ stores to the brink.\n\nIt is clearly true that consumers' shift to e-commerce\
      \ companies like Amazon has forced many traditional retailers to close stores.\
      \ But other megastores like Walmart (WMT) share much of the blame for that.\n\
      \nAmazon says that it actually helps small companies succeed in the difficult\
      \ retail climate. For example, it allows small businesses to sell their products\
      \ to a mass audience when they otherwise wouldn't be able to achieve global\
      \ scale."

    text: '(CNN) In just seven days, enough news has come out of Washington to forget
      that last Sunday, porn star Stormy Daniels gave a much-anticipated interview
      to Anderson Cooper on CBS'' 60 Minutes about her alleged affair with President
      Donald Trump.


      If you spent this holiday weekend away from your newsfeeds and phones, here
      are the top stories from the last week.


      At Mar-a-Lago, Trump attacks Amazon and the Washington Post


      While in Florida on Saturday, Trump tweeted attacks at Amazon, accusing the
      company of scamming the US Postal Service.


      "While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will
      lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts
      to Billions of Dollars," Trump tweeted Saturday morning.


      "The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ''the size of the company''s lobbying staff
      has ballooned,'' and that......does not include the Fake Washington Post, which
      is used as a ''lobbyist'' and should so REGISTER," he wrote. "If the P.O. ''increased
      its parcel rates, Amazon''s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.''"


      He added, "This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and
      taxes) now."


      But CNN reported that while the Postal Service is losing money, its package
      delivery service is profitable, unlike its letter delivery.


      Trump''s attack came days after he tweeted another accusation about Amazon not
      paying "taxes to state & local governments" and "putting many thousands of retailers
      out of business." Amazon collects sales tax in every state it is required to,
      which is nearly every state.


      The company is currently looking for its second headquarters to be placed somewhere
      around the country. Currently, Washington, DC, and the surrounding areas are
      under consideration.


      Trump called for the end of a DACA deal


      On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he was not in favor of making a deal with Democrats
      on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.


      "Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border
      because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting
      more dangerous. ''Caravans'' coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to
      pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL," Trump tweeted Sunday morning.


      A caravan of approximately 1,100 people are currently traveling from Chiapas,
      Mexico, along the Guatemala border, and have traveled about 420 miles to Oaxaca,
      Mexico, about 285 miles to the southeast of Mexico City.


      The migrants would not qualify for DACA protections, a program Trump put an
      end to last year.


      Trump is returning to a White House without Hope Hicks


      On Thursday, former White House communications director Hope Hicks finally left
      the building, resigning as she announced she would in February. The departure
      left many wondering who would fill the void left by Hicks, who was a loyal confidante
      to the President.


      That answer could lie with Dan Scavino , the social media director who quickly
      moved his things into the office that Hicks used to occupy during her tenure.
      Scavino is the last remaining staffer from the launch of Trump''s presidential
      campaign who is still close to Trump fourteen months into his presidency.


      As far as a new communications director goes, Trump may not care to find one
      at all. On Friday, CNN reported that several of Trump''s outside advisers have
      told him over the past week that finding a new communications director may not
      necessarily be a priority. Still, though, the President has shown no indication
      that he''s going to take their advice.


      Rep. Esty plans to weather calls for her resignation


      Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty announced Friday that she plans to stay in Congress
      amid calls for her to resign over her mishandling of a personnel issue in her
      office.


      The Connecticut lawmaker kept then-chief of staff Tony Baker for several months
      despite knowing about abuse allegations made against him by another member of
      her staff, The Washington Post reported.


      In a statement, Esty vowed to work to improve workplace culture on Capitol Hill
      and to strengthen workplace protections and ways for staff to raise concerns.


      Out of a job, Shulkin refuses to endorse his successor


      David Shulkin, the recently fired Veterans Affairs secretary, declined on CNN''s
      "State of the Union" Sunday to offer a full endorsement of Ronny Jackson, Trump''s
      pick to replace him.


      Shulkin and the White House are currently touting two different versions of
      his ouster, with the White House saying he resigned and Shulkin telling CNN,
      "I did not resign."


      Regardless, what''s clear is that Shulkin''s post came to an abrupt end after
      an inspector general took issue with the VA''s use of taxpayer funds on Shulkin''s
      travel. Defending the use of those funds, Shulkin has said that political adversaries
      are simply using that report as a "political exploit" to remove him from leadership.


      Jackson will have to resign his commission and retire from active duty before
      he can be confirmed by the Senate as VA secretary.


      McCabe raising money like a pro


      In 48 hours, fired FBI Deputy Director Andre McCabe raised double his fundraising
      goal for a legal defense fund. By Sunday afternoon, a GoFundMe page had collected
      $533,403. At its creation on Thursday, the page was only seeking to raise $250,000.


      The page says the fund is intended for use in dealing with a Department of Justice
      inspector general investigation, congressional inquires, and potential lawsuits.


      In an email to CNN, a spokesperson for McCabe said: "Although we know legal
      fees could exceed that based on the path ahead, we will not be raising the goal
      again."


      McCabe was fired in March by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the FBI''s
      Office of Professional Responsibility concluded McCabe had made an "unauthorized
      disclosure to the news media."


      Trump cannot find a lawyer in a town of full of them


      Trump struggled this week to find legal help to represent him during the Russia
      probe. Five large firms are passing on the opportunity to represent the President
      after a recent shakeup on his private defense team.


      According to people familiar with their decisions, well-known Washington lawyers
      decided to pass up the opportunity because Trump appears to be a difficult client
      and has rebuked some of his lawyers'' advice. They also see any kind of help
      as potentially damaging to their reputations because he''s often perceived as
      so politically unpopular.'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Last year, Justice Anthony Kennedy traveled to the White
      House, robes and all, and found himself in a familiar spot: the center of attention.


      The assembled audience was there for the swearing in of Justice Neil Gorsuch,
      but many eyes were trained on Kennedy, who like no other justice in recent history
      controls the outcome of the highest profile cases before the court.


      Kennedy''s role that day was to deliver the oath to his former clerk, but some
      of the judicial conservatives assembled in the Rose Garden were wondering if
      Kennedy might soon provide them with the opportunity to return to their vetting
      binders. Would he retire and give President Donald Trump a second vacancy and
      the chance to cement a conservative majority on the court for decades to come?


      A few weeks later, even the President got pulled in to the guessing game: "I''ve
      heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard," he said from the oval
      office, according to the Washington Times


      In the end, Kennedy made no announcement. After almost 30 years on the highest
      court in the land, he determined he wasn''t quite finished.


      Now, as retirement speculation ramps up again, court watchers wonder what went
      into his calculation for staying on the bench last term -- and if anything''s
      changed since then.

      Significant cases facing the court could have served as the siren call, or maybe
      Kennedy felt the weight -- and pull -- that one of his colleagues called the
      "awesome responsibility" of holding the critical vote for the biggest cases.
      It''s conceivable he was spooked by the volatile first few months of the Trump
      administration, or perhaps retirement is easier to contemplate than to execute.


      Whatever motivated Kennedy to stay, conservatives waiting for a chance to push
      the court to the right were disappointed. And liberals, even though they have
      been on the losing end of Kennedy votes on issues such as campaign finance and
      the Second Amendment, now cling to him. He has, after all, given them victories
      in LGBT rights, abortion access, affirmative action and his replacement under
      the Trump administration would surely be much younger and more conservative.


      There is no underestimating his impact. Kennedy was in the majority for 97%
      of all cases during the 2016-17 Supreme Court term, according to statistics
      compiled by Scotusblog . In cases where judges were divided, Kennedy was in
      the majority 93% of the time, by far the highest percentage of the nine justices.


      Partisan gerrymandering


      The speculation about Kennedy''s future comes as the justices are considering
      an unusual number of extraordinarily consequential cases where his vote and
      input will be critical.


      For example, partisan gerrymandering is front and center. The Supreme Court
      has never been able to articulate a test concerning the overreliance on politics
      in map drawing.


      Back in 2004, the court rejected a challenge to a political gerrymander in Pennsylvania.
      While four justices believed that courts should never hear such cases, Kennedy
      held the door open in a separate opinion.


      Kennedy acknowledged that ordering a correction of all election district lines
      for partisan reasons might amount to an "unprecedented intervention in the American
      political process," but he would not foreclose the possibility of judicial relief
      down road. He said that in the future a "limited and precise rationale" might
      emerge.


      That day may or may not have come this term as the court is hearing not one,
      but two cases concerning the issue.


      At oral arguments during one of the cases concerning Wisconsin last October,
      Kennedy did seem open at one point to the possibility that a standard grounded
      in the First Amendment could be found.


      In late March, the court heard a second challenge regarding a map in Maryland.
      It was clear during oral arguments that the justices were still struggling with
      the issue.


      At one point Justice Stephen Breyer even suggested that the court take the two
      cases and another one pending out of North Carolina and hold rearguments next
      term.


      "Some of us saw this as a plea to get Justice Kennedy to stay on the court to
      see this to the end," Rick Hasen a professor at University of California-Irvine,
      opined


      A workable framework could be a landmark opinion that could revolutionize how
      states draw their lines.


      "If Justice Kennedy agrees with plaintiffs in either of these cases, then he''ll
      be known for decades as the justice who succeeded in rooting out the worst abuses
      in partisan gerrymandering," said Josh Douglas, a professor University of Kentucky
      College of Law. "Making his mark on this issue could be one of the reasons he
      hasn''t retired yet."

      Gay marriage and religious liberty


      Kennedy will forever be remembered for penning Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015
      opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.


      This term, the justices are considering Masterpiece Cakeshop v. the Colorado
      Civil Rights Commission , a case that some believe is a follow up to Obergefell.


      In Obergefell, Kennedy wrote that opponents to same-sex marriage reached their
      conclusions based on "decent and honorable religious" beliefs.


      In Masterpiece, however, Colorado cake baker Jack Phillips, who believes marriage
      should be between a man and a woman, refused to make a cake for customers seeking
      to celebrate their same-sex marriage.


      Now Kennedy might have to reconcile two strands of his jurisprudence: the dignity
      of same-sex couples and the respect for religious liberty.


      At oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts referred back to Kennedy''s words
      in Obergefell and noted that the majority had "gone out of its way to talk about
      the decent and honorable people who may have opposing views."


      Kennedy did seem, at one point, to be receptive to the religious liberty concerns
      of the baker. Kennedy pointed out that a commissioner on the Colorado Civil
      Rights Commissioned had expressed hostility toward Phlipps''s beliefs.


      "It seems to me that the state in its position here has been neither tolerant
      nor respectful of Mr. Phillips''s religious beliefs," Kennedy said.

      Ivanka Trump visits the court


      Journalist Charlie Rose asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2017 about Kennedy''s
      role as the deciding vote in so many hot button cases.


      It''s an "awesome responsibility" she said.


      At another event held in California in 2017, one questioner took a different
      tack when asking the question.


      "Who do you want to eat more kale in Washington?" the questioner asked.


      Ginsburg and other liberals are well aware of the President''s promise to reshape
      the courts.


      One question is whether Kennedy would feel comfortable retiring during the Trump
      administration.


      Heads spun just after the inauguration in February, when Ivanka Trump appeared
      at the court and sat in the section reserved for VIPs to hear oral arguments.
      According to the court''s spokeswoman, the President''s daughter was there as
      the invited guest of Kennedy, who she met at the inaugural lunch at the Capitol.


      It wasn''t lost on court watchers that Trump chose a former Kennedy clerk as
      his first pick. Other former Kennedy clerks such as Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh,
      of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Judge Raymond
      Kethledge of the 6th Circuit are high on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees.


      Midterm impacts


      Like every other Justice, Kennedy cares about the institution of the court and
      he will take that into consideration whenever he chooses to step down.


      As a rule, justices don''t like to retire in an election year, always trying
      to keep the court at an arm''s length from the political process.


      When Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died in 2016 the court was forced to
      work with only eight members for more than a year as the political branches
      went to war over Scalia''s replacement. The eight-member court is not ideal
      because if the justices split 4-4, they are simply left to affirm the lower
      court opinion creating no new precedent.


      And all eyes will be on November, with the potential for Democrats to take over
      the Senate.


      In January, conservative court watcher Ed Whelan wrote for the National Review
      that "if the rumors are true that Justice Kennedy has been looking to retire,
      then it seems a reasonable bet that he would do so this spring," he said.


      "Indeed, the very real prospect that Democrats will win control of the Senate
      in the November 2018 elections might clinch his decision to do so. If he waits
      until next year, and if Democrats take control of the Senate, his seat would
      probably remain empty until 2021," Whelan speculated.


      Between now and June, Kennedy has almost a full docket of cases to consider.
      It''s a real possibility that he hasn''t even made up his mind.


      He''s hired clerks for next term, but warned at least one, two sources say,
      that retirement is always a possibility. There is precedent for the clerks who
      are hired by one justice to be absorbed by another justice if a retirement occurs.
      Indeed, Gorsuch was hired by Jusstice Byron White but served out his clerkship
      with Kennedy after White retired in 1993.


      Court watchers, even some in the White House at the time, thought that Justice
      John Paul Stevens would retire long before he finally did so in 2010.


      And some may say that Kennedy, is still a youngster at 81.'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our DC insiders are talking about
      in this week''s "Inside Politics" forecast, where you get a glimpse of tomorrow''s
      headlines today.


      1) Scalise''s House money


      This past week House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise formed a new leadership
      PAC, sending the Washington rumor mill into overdrive. It''s all about the Speaker
      of the House spot, and whether Paul Ryan will stay on for another term.


      As The Daily Beast''s Jackie Kucinich explains, Scalise''s new PAC is a bid
      by the Louisiana Republican for greater influence.


      "Yes, Steve Scalise has raised a lot of money for Republicans going into this
      election year. But Paul Ryan-affiliated Super PACs are poised to spend more
      than any Republican outside group in the 2018 elections," Kucinich reports.


      "Now, should they (Republicans) lose the House, or, should the House become
      smaller, it''s going to be conservative, it''s going to be more Southern, it''s
      going to be more white," she adds. "So, when you look at that dynamic, and if
      Paul Ryan steps aside, Steve Scalise fits that conference a lot better than,
      say, (House Majority Leader) Kevin McCarthy."


      2) A diplomatic test in Peru


      President Trump isn''t afraid of turnover: He''s welcoming a new Secretary of
      State nominee and a new CIA director nominee, thanks to the latest administration
      shakeups.


      But Trump''s new hires will soon face a diplomatic test, The New York Times''
      Michael Shear explains.


      "In a couple of weeks, the President will go on his first real overseas trip
      for this year. He''s going to Lima, Peru, for the Summit of the Americas. There
      are a couple of things to watch for ... this is the first test of his new national
      security team -- a new secretary of state, national security adviser, CIA director,"
      Shear says.


      "Also (to watch for), whether or not scandals from back home -- the Russia investigation
      -- dog him while he''s there."


      3) Haspel on the hot seat


      The president''s pick for CIA director, Gina Haspel, has to go through congressional
      questioning as part of the confirmation process. She is slated to begin answering
      those inquires as early as Monday.


      As The Washington Post''s Karoun Demirjian reports, there are quite a few topics
      that Senator John McCain plans to ask her about.


      "There have been all of these questions surrounding her tenure at the CIA, how
      closely it involved torture, or enhanced interrogation techniques that we have
      come to call torture. She, for a while, served as supervisor for a black-site
      prison that was known for conducting these sorts of things," Demirjian reports.


      "If Democrats all stay together and oppose this nomination, Republicans cannot
      lose a single vote or they (will) lose ... and that is actually a very big deal
      for Trump."


      4) What Trump''s Baltic summit may say about Russia


      President Trump will welcome Baltic leaders from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
      this week. The Baltic summit could have big consequences for another country
      --- Russia.


      Bloomberg''s Margaret Talev explains.


      "The timing ends up being really important, because we''re at such crosshairs
      now on Russia," Talev says. She tells observers to watch "the signaling that
      he does with those three leaders -- he''ll send important signals on that."'

      slammed survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, calling them "liars"
      and "poor, mushy-brained children."


      Nugent made the comments during an interview on "The Joe Pags Show," a nationally
      syndicated conservative radio program.


      "All you have to do now is not only feel sorry for the liars, but you have to
      go against them and pray to God that the lies can be crushed and the liars can
      be silenced so that real measures can be put into place to actually save children''s
      lives," Nugent said about the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students.


      "These poor children, I''m afraid to say this and it hurts me to say this, but
      the evidence is irrefutable, they have no soul," he added.


      Nugent''s comments come six weeks after 17 people were gunned down at the high
      school, reigniting a national debate on the nation''s gun laws. An outspoken

    text: 'Story highlights An internal FBI report shows McCabe and Comey had differing
      accounts


      The internal report was the grounds for McCabe''s firing earlier this month


      (CNN) The internal FBI report that served as grounds for the firing of FBI Deputy
      Director Andrew McCabe includes key testimony from his former boss that shows
      a discrepancy with McCabe''s public statements, according to multiple sources
      familiar with the report.


      Former FBI Director James Comey told internal investigators at the Justice Department
      that he could not recall McCabe telling him about having authorized FBI officials
      to talk to a reporter about an ongoing investigation, the sources said.


      Comey''s comments to the Justice Department''s inspector general''s office,
      which were later included as part of the FBI''s Office of Professional Responsibility
      report on McCabe that prompted his firing earlier this month, put him at odds
      with the statements McCabe has made about authorizing FBI officials to provide
      information to the Wall Street Journal in an October 2016 story about FBI and
      Justice Department tensions over an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.


      McCabe has publicly maintained that he was in a position to authorize the other
      FBI officials speaking with the reporter and that Comey was aware McCabe had
      done it.


      "It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including
      the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter," McCabe said
      in a statement the night he was fired.

    text: '(CNN) President Donald Trump is continuing his attack against Amazon, accusing
      the company of scamming the US Postal Service.


      "While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will
      lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts
      to Billions of Dollars," Trump tweeted Saturday morning.


      "The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ''the size of the company''s lobbying staff
      has ballooned,'' and that......does not include the Fake Washington Post, which
      is used as a ''lobbyist'' and should so REGISTER," the President wrote. "If
      the P.O. ''increased its parcel rates, Amazon''s shipping costs would rise by
      $2.6 Billion.''"


      He added, "This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and
      taxes) now."


      Is it a ''scam''?

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump''s unexpected announcement on Thursday
      that the US would "be coming out of Syria like very soon" is raising concerns
      among some national security officials who warn that withdrawing now would not
      only undermine American credibility in the region but prompt a significant escalation
      to an already devastating conflict.


      While Trump has often touted the gains made against ISIS since taking office,
      his latest comments caught much of his own administration off-guard -- including
      defense officials who have warned that now is not the time to withdraw from
      Syria.


      "We''re knocking the hell out of ISIS. We''ll be coming out of Syria like very
      soon," Trump told supporters outside of Cleveland during a speech that was meant
      to focus on infrastructure." Let the other people take care of it now."


      Several US defense officials have told CNN that the Pentagon has not heard any
      additional details from the White House since the President''s remarks -- adding
      that the policy hasn''t changed and that they are continuing to focus on their
      fight against ISIS.


      One official said the assumption is the President has had a number of briefings
      saying ISIS is about to be defeated and that many assume Trump was just rhetorically
      taking it to the next step.


      A National Security Council meeting is set for Tuesday to discuss the administration''s
      plan for battling ISIS in Syria, a senior administration official confirmed
      Saturday.


      Any decision by Trump to pull out of Syria would also go against the current
      military assessment, a fact that left some national security officials concerned
      about the impact of a withdrawal, another senior administration official told
      CNN.


      Who has the most to lose?


      The US maintains about 2,000 US troops in Syria, and primarily backs the Syrian
      Democratic Forces in the fight against ISIS, a group that is about 50% Arab
      and 50% Kurdish; however, much of the group''s leadership is Kurdish.


      The President''s apparent desire to exit Syria as soon as possible is likely
      to raise concerns among US backed groups in the region, particularly the SDF,
      and could embolden the forces of the Syrian regime, Iran and Turkey, all of
      which have mostly resisted attacking US allies in Syria due to concerns about
      US retaliation.


      "A lot of what keeps SDF in the field is the other forces can''t touch them,"
      according to David Adesnik, the director of research at the Foundation for Defense
      of Democracies. "Without US support how well will they perform and if they find
      themselves in a weak position will they cut a deal with regime?"


      Recently, the presence of US Forces deterred Russian mercenaries and regime
      forces from attempting to seize oil fields and other territory controlled by
      the SDF but without the presence of American troops there is nothing stopping
      those same forces from attacking again.


      A similar dynamic exists in Manbij and At Tanf, where US Forces have deterred
      Turkish and regime forces from any large scale attacks.


      The US is also helping SDF forces secure Syria''s border with Iraq as ISIS still
      maintains a presence in the area but that job becomes much more difficult without
      American assistance.


      A US withdraw could help ISIS


      If the US were to withdraw, the de facto spheres of influence that have spared
      eastern Syria the same kind of fighting and bloodshed that the civil war has
      brought to the west would likely collapse, inviting a major escalation in the
      conflict.


      That chaos could be exploited by ISIS which has already benefited from Turkey''s
      actions in northern Syria.


      Earlier this month, the US warned that ISIS has begun reconstituting in some
      areas of Syria because a Turkish military offensive against a northern city
      has pulled the US'' Kurdish allies away from the fight against the terrorist
      group.


      "We are very concerned about the effect fighting there has had on our defeat
      ISIS efforts and would like to see an end to the hostilities before ISIS has
      the opportunity to regroup in eastern Syria," said Pentagon spokesman US Army
      Col. Rob Manning, discussing the Turkish offensive against Afrin.


      The State Department went a step farther, saying that ISIS has already begun
      to rebuild in places.


      "The fighting in western Syria over the last two months, including in Afrin,
      has distracted from the defeat ISIS campaign and provided opportunity for ISIS
      to begin reconstituting in some areas," State Department spokeswoman Heather
      Nauert said last week.


      US officials have been warning for weeks that the Turkish military campaign
      against Kurdish forces in Afrin, launched January 20, could undermine the fight
      against ISIS, as Kurdish fighters helping the US battle the terrorist group
      began leaving to help their compatriots there. But the Turks see the US'' Kurdish
      allies as terrorists and have strongly pushed back against US claims that their
      involvement has a negative impact on the campaign against ISIS.


      "The claim that the operation conducted against terrorists in Afrin would endanger
      the combat against DAESH is completely groundless," said a statement from the
      Turkish Foreign Ministry last week, using the Arabic name for ISIS. "The approach
      that actually undermines the combat against terrorism in Syria is the use of
      one terrorist organization against another."


      In a January speech laying out the Trump administration''s policy on Syria,
      then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would remain in Syria until
      the group is routed. "The United States will maintain a military presence in
      Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge," Tillerson said at Stanford
      University. "The fight against ISIS is not over."


      Russia, Iran and Turkey stand to benefit


      The involvement of both US and Russian forces in Syria has complicated the conflict,
      leaving the countries conduct a delicate dance in order to avoid directly attacking
      one another.


      That hasn''t always worked, though.


      Several Russians hired as paramilitary contractors to fight with pro-Assad forces
      were killed by US air strikes in February , according to friends and family
      of those killed. The US and Russia have maintained "deconfliction" communications
      channels to avoid direct combat, but the lines do not prevent all conflicts.


      A US withdrawal would create a vacuum in the area, similar to what happened
      after soldiers left Iraq, and most foreign policy experts agree that void would
      likely be filled by Russia.


      Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European
      Studies at Georgetown University, told CNN on Friday that "if the US were to
      withdraw, it seems to me the Russians would have a free hand" in Syria and the
      forces "fighting Assad would be weakened."


      "I do wonder if that is something the President thought about when he made that
      announcement," Stent said, noting that any departure would elevate Russia''s
      status to make it "the main power broker in that area."


      Additionally, Stent said, a US withdrawal would help Iran, a country whose forces
      are fighting alongside Russians in Syria.


      If the US were to leave its base located at the At Tanf garrison in southeastern
      Syria, Iran would be able to secure its overland route from Damascus to Tehran,
      further securing its regional influence.


      Given Trump has routinely advocated for tougher policies on Iran, the US would
      be "cutting off our nose to spite our face" by withdrawing from Syria, Adesnik
      said.


      Along with Russia, Iran and the Syrian regime could also benefit from the economic
      advantages of seizing oilfields currently controlled by US-backed allies.


      The regime lost roughly 90% of its oil production when the civil war began,
      according to Adesnik.'

      \ White House Easter Egg Roll, taking place Monday on the South Lawn.\n\nOrchestrated\
      \ by the East Wing, the festivities are Melania Trump's second crack at the\
      \ Egg Roll as first lady and her first as a full-time White House resident.\
      \ Last year, Trump, who was living in New York through the completion of the\
      \ school year, oversaw the event, which marked a scaling-down and return to\
      \ basics for the annual eggstravaganza. But this year's Egg Roll will showcase\
      \ a first lady who has more fully embraced the role of White House hostess,\
      \ just weeks before the White House holds its first formal state visit with\
      \ France\n\nThis year's Egg Roll will feature activity stations, including the\
      \ first lady's new addition of lawn bowling, as well as the egg rolling, egg\
      \ and cookie decorating stations, a state egg display, cards for troops and\
      \ costumed characters. The White House is expecting nearly 30,000 attendees\
      \ at the event, which will feature entertainment from the US Marine, Army, Air\
      \ Force and Navy Bands. Readers at the reading nook will include the first lady,\
      \ director of national intelligence Dan Coats, Secretaries Elaine Chao and Betsy\
      \ DeVos, and director of legislative affairs Marc Short.\n\nRolling tradition\n\
      \nThe egg rolling tradition began in the 1870s on Capitol grounds. After a particularly\
      \ rotten 1876 roll in which eyewitness John C. Rathbone observed \"the wanton\
      \ destruction of the grass on the terraces of the park,\" President Ulysses\
      \ S. Grant signed legislation to protect Capitol grounds, which prohibited egg\
      \ rolling, per the National Archives\n\nBut in 1878, a more egg-friendly President\
      \ Rutherford B. Hayes allowed children to roll their eggs on the White House\
      \ South Lawn.\n\nAccording to an article in that evening's edition of the Evening\
      \ Star, per the National Archives, the children were quite pleased with their\
      \ new egg rolling headquarters: \"Driven out of the Capitol grounds, the children\
      \ advanced on the White House grounds to-day and rolled eggs down the terraces\
      \ back of the Mansion, and played among the shrubbery to their heart's content.\"\
      \n\nNow, 140 years later the tradition continues, this year as a collaboration\
      \ between the White House, the White House Historical Association, and the National\
      \ Park Service.\n\nIt's always been a big production for the first lady's office.\n\
      \nFlorence Harding dyed the eggs herself in 1921, The Washington Post reported\n\
      \nIn 1927, the Post reported that Grace Coolidge brought her pet raccoon, Rebecca,\
      \ out on the grounds on a leash, much to the raccoon's chagrin.\n\nFirst Lady\
      \ Grace Coolidge is seen holding her pet raccoon, Rebecca.\n\n\"The crush was\
      \ too much for Rebecca and she showed her displeasure plainly. But the first\
      \ lady was not so easily discouraged. She carried the pet indoors and returned\
      \ to the delight of the crowd,\" the report said.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt oversaw\
      \ the egg roll during her husband's four terms in office, including 1937, when\
      \ more than 50,000 children attended. Cold weather was to blame for depressed\
      \ turnout in 1940, when just under 5,500 children attended, per the Syracuse\
      \ Herald-Journal.\n\nRecent history\n\nDuring the Obama administration, first\
      \ lady Michelle Obama used the Egg Roll to promote her \"Let's Move\" initiative,\
      \ and the star-studded lineup included performances by Justin Bieber and Ariana\
      \ Grande. Beyonc\xE9 and Jay-Z were among the attendees in 2016.\n\nThe tradition\
      \ of the costumed Easter Bunny began with a Pat Nixon staff member in 1969,\
      \ per the White House Historical Association.\n\nFormer Trump administration\
      \ press secretary Sean Spicer has a history with the Egg Roll himself: as a\
      \ staffer in the George W. Bush administration, he was the man inside the Easter\
      \ bunny suit. He did not reprise the role last year -- that we know of.\n\n\
      To this day, the Egg Roll remains one of the only times of the year that the\
      \ White House South Lawn is open to the public (with tickets) to enjoy.\n\n\
      You can now get a set of five official White House Easter Egg Roll commemorative\
      \ eggs for $34.95 from @WhiteHouseHstry . They're wooden, with a seal on the\
      \ front and a @POTUS and @FLOTUS signature on the back https://t.co/WKiwxVyheS\

      \nIn addition to the thousands of hard boiled eggs on the South Lawn, guests\
      \ will receive an official wooden White House Easter Egg, which this year features\
      \ a presidential seal on the front and the President and First Lady's signature\
      \ on the back.\n\nThe Incredible Egg, which provides all 30,000 real eggs for\
      \ rolling, dyeing, and eating, also provides the first lady with a commemorative\
      \ egg gift of her own. The 2018 Commemorative Egg, the 41st of its kind, was\
      \ designed by Master Egg Artist Deborah Grassel, who holds a Masters in Egg\
      \ Art from the International Egg Art Guild.\n\nThe ornate glass egg opens up\

    text: '(CNN) The White House is using a new website to collect and share stories
      from Americans about how they or someone they know overcame opioid addiction.


      The website invites visitors to "share your story below by uploading a video
      about how you overcame addiction, volunteered at a recovery center, or worked
      as a family to help a loved one get on the path to recovery." Below that is
      a link to a form where individuals can upload their stories and an accompanying
      note.


      The website, which the President announced earlier this month, frames the issue
      as "the crisis next door." It comes after Trump said his administration will
      push a "large-scale" ad campaign aimed at combating the opioid epidemic. The
      administration is also proposing stiffer penalties for high-intensity drug traffickers,
      including the death penalty for some.


      In a video statement, President Donald Trump says the crisis is all around,
      but that fact is too often forgotten.


      "Stigma, silence and a lack of information prevent us from confronting this
      crisis as we should," the President said. "We launch this website to bring together

    text: '(CNN) A political appointee at the Department of Defense has resigned after
      a CNN KFile inquiry about controversial postings he made on Facebook.


      Todd Johnson is a former Trump campaign state director in New Mexico who joined
      the Department of Defense in 2017 as an advance officer, a Pentagon employee
      with the sensitive task of providing logistical support related to the secretary''s
      events and appearances domestically and abroad. Johnson had a pay scale of GS-14,
      typically reserved for senior civil service positions.


      A CNN KFile review of his social media found that Johnson posted birther conspiracies
      about then-President Barack Obama and shared a video that claimed Obama was
      the Antichrist.


      After CNN initially reached out to the Pentagon for comment, Johnson made his

      at the Pentagon Tuesday morning, but in the afternoon, after CNN informed the
      Department of Defense that a story was forthcoming, a Pentagon spokesperson

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has told President Donald
      Trump''s lawyers that the President is not currently being considered a criminal
      target of the Russia probe, The Washington Post reported Tuesday, citing three
      people familiar with the discussions.


      The special counsel''s team is compiling a report on Trump''s actions as President

      lawyers, two people with knowledge of the conversations told the Post.


      The report notes that Mueller continues to seek an interview with Trump himself.
      CNN reported Friday that attorneys for both sides sat down for an in-person
      meeting on topics that investigators could ask the President about, according
      to two sources familiar with the talks.


      CNN reported in January that Mueller''s team had given the President''s lawyers
      general topics for an interview, such as Trump''s request that then-FBI director
      James Comey drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael
      Flynn, his reaction to Comey''s May 2017 testimony on Capitol Hill and Trump''s
      contact with intelligence officials about the Russia investigation.

    text: 'Van der Zwaan''s communications with Gates and a person with Russian intelligence
      ties became important to the special counsel''s broader investigation, as it
      pursues crimes related to Russian interference in the 2016 election, Mueller''s
      team has said.


      Van der Zwaan "took steps to ingratiate himself with" Gates and Manafort and
      hid that from his law firm, "and that''s why he lied," Jackson said Tuesday
      before she delivered his sentence.


      "This is not something that happened to him. This is something he did," she
      added. "He put his personal interest ahead of the interest of justice."


      Van der Zwaan''s wealth and family connections were apparent as he awaited his
      sentence during the two-hour court appearance. Though he slouched with his arm
      on the defense table, pursed his lips and stroked his chin throughout, the 33-year-old
      lawyer spruced up his navy suit with cufflinks, a teal tie and white pocket
      square and slicked-back hair. He was accompanied by about eight lawyers and
      supporters, including his father.


      "What I did was wrong," he said to the judge, reading quietly from a single
      sheet of paper after his defense attorney and the prosecutor each spoke. "I
      apologize to the court for my conduct. I apologize to my wife and family."


      Van der Zwaan had faced a maximum of five years in prison and a quarter-million-dollar
      fine for lying to investigators, though federal recommendations had put his
      likely sentence between zero and six months.


      His defense attorneys begged for the judge not to give him any prison time and
      asked for him to be sentenced to a minimum-security federal prison in Pennsylvania,
      though that is to be determined.


      His attorney, William Schwartz, noted that Van Der Zwaan''s wife, the daughter
      of Russian oligarch German Khan, is six months pregnant and has had some difficulty
      in London without her husband. Van der Zwaan awaited his sentencing for the
      last month while gripped with "boredom and anxiety" while living in a hotel,
      Schwartz said.


      ''Should know better''


      Van der Zwaan covered up his discussions with Gates and a business associate
      based in Ukraine in September 2016, while the Trump campaign operation was in
      full swing. After speaking with the special counsel''s office in a voluntary
      interview in November and confronted with the email he had hid, van der Zwaan
      was subpoenaed by Mueller to appear before a grand jury. A few weeks later,
      as he re-entered the country, federal authorities confiscated his passport.
      He then returned to Mueller''s office in December to confess to the lies and
      to give Mueller''s team access to his various laptops and cell phones.


      Weissmann noted Tuesday that van der Zwaan had lied to his law firm and to former
      White House counsel Greg Craig, the senior partner with whom he worked before
      he was fired, about his interactions with Gates. He also had lied years ago
      about helping Gates to spin an independent report he worked on in favor of Gates''
      and Manafort''s political clients in Ukraine.


      "This is not an isolated incident of simply making one bad decision," Weissmann
      told the judge Tuesday. Van Der Zwaan "demonstrated a moral compass that was
      off-kilter."


      Weissmann declined to ask the judge to give van Der Zwaan a specific length
      of sentence.


      However, the prosecutor noted how closely watched this case has been and asked
      the judge for a sentence that would deter other witnesses from misleading the
      federal prosecutors, especially since he was a lawyer "who should know better."


      "We count on people to tell us the truth. We count on people to turn over documents,"
      Weissmann said.


      Van der Zwaan was the fourth guilty plea in the Mueller investigation after
      Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser
      Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators last year and agreed
      to cooperate, and an online supplier of fake usernames pleaded guilty to identity
      fraud in February. Gates later took a plea deal and has been cooperating with
      investigators.


      Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, has pleaded not guilty to two
      sets of federal charges, and prosecutors revealed they could investigate allegations
      that he colluded with Russians to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.


      Mueller has also indicted 13 Russians for their work to influence the 2016 presidential
      election through online social media.


      Unlike other defendants, van der Zwaan did not enter into an ongoing cooperation

    text: 'Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has picked a veteran
      prosecutor to help him oversee the Russia probe at the Justice Department as
      the Special Counsel''s investigation deepens.


      Ed O''Callaghan will serve as the acting Principal Associate Deputy Attorney
      General, according to a Justice Department official.


      The powerful post, commonly known as the "Padag" within the department, advises
      the Deputy Attorney General on all major investigations and policy matters,
      but generally floats under the radar.


      Yet O''Callaghan now lands in the thick of the highest-profile investigation
      at the Justice Department, ensnarling former Trump campaign associates. Late
      Monday evening, prosecutors in the Russia probe revealed Rosenstein has granted
      the special counsel''s office wide latitude to investigate former Trump campaign
      chairman Paul Manafort''s connections to Russian government officials. Thus
      far, the special counsel''s office has charged 19 people and three companies,
      and one person has been sentenced


      A long-time federal prosecutor and counterterrorism expert in New York, O''Callaghan
      most recently served as the acting head of the DOJ''s National Security Division.
      He raised eyebrows of some former DOJ officials earlier this year when he took
      to the White House podium to defend the Trump administration''s use of contested
      terrorism figures to encourage changes to immigration policies.

    text: 'Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that

      The devices could be the work of foreign governments or entities, however, DHS

      are known alternatively as Stingrays, IMSI catchers or cell-site simulators.
      The devices essentially act as fake cellphone towers, and as mobile devices
      connect to them, the devices are able to snoop on the traffic that goes through.


      Responding to an inquiry from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, DHS top infrastructure
      and cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs confirmed that DHS has detected
      activity consistent with such devices. Law enforcement in the US does use such
      techniques as well, though courts have been scrutinizing that.


      DHS "has observed anomalous activity in the National Capital Region (NCR) that

      Krebs was responding to a question from Wyden as to whether DHS had evidence

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Tuesday and
      tweeted at length about immigration and border security, saying the US "basically"
      has "no border."


      Here''s what he said and what the reality is.


      The caravan


      Trump: "I just noticed that the caravan now, which is toward the middle of Mexico,
      coming up from Honduras, is breaking up very rapidly. That''s because Mexico
      has very strong immigration laws, as we should have. ... I''ve just heard that
      the caravan coming up from Honduras is broken up, and Mexico did that. And they
      did it because, frankly, I said you really have to do it."


      There is an annual event organized by activists where migrants caravan through
      Mexico to the US, designed to highlight the dangerous journey that immigrants
      must undertake to escape violent and unstable conditions in their home countries.
      The migrants on the journey hope to make it to the US border, where they can
      make a claim that they qualify for asylum.


      Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted Tuesday that Mexican officials
      had told her the "caravan is dissipating" and that several hundred of the migrants
      had been sent back to their home countries, while others are being offered refugee
      status. "I thank the GOM (Government of Mexico) for their partnership on this
      and other security issues," she tweeted.


      Earlier Tuesday, Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Luis Videgaray Caso had tweeted
      the caravan was "dispersing" on its own and that Mexico''s immigration policies
      would not be influenced by foreign threats. The Foreign Ministry told CNN that
      the caravan was not necessarily ending but that people were separating. In a
      statement Monday night, Mexico''s Foreign Ministry had said that roughly 400
      of the participants had been returned to their home countries. Organizers still
      estimated that over 1,000 participants were continuing on the journey.


      Military on the border


      Trump: "We have very bad laws for our border and we are going to be doing some
      things, I spoke with (Defense Secretary) Gen. (James) Mattis, we''re going to
      do some things militarily, until we can have a wall and proper security -- we''re
      going to be guarding our border with the military. That''s a big step."


      Reality: The administration has yet to articulate how this plan will work.


      Military resources being used for border security would not be entirely novel.
      For one, the US Army Corps of Engineers already handles border infrastructure
      and construction.


      The National Guard has also been sent to the border in the past, especially
      during surges of migration much higher than levels seen today.


      From 2006 to 2008, under President George W. Bush, 6,000 National Guard troops
      were deployed to southern border states under Operation Jump Start. The troops
      repaired and constructed border fencing and flew border protection agents by
      helicopter to intercept immigrants trying to enter illegally. In 2010, the Obama
      administration deployed National Guard troops to assist US Customs and Border
      Protection with surveillance and intelligence gathering while the agency worked
      to hire additional staff.


      And in 2014, as a surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America crossed
      into the United States, Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced the activation of up
      to 1,000 National Guard troops to help secure the southern border.


      Federal law explicitly prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement,
      however, without approval from Congress.


      Catch and release


      Trump: "President Obama made changes that basically created no border, called
      ''catch and release.'' You catch them. You register them. They go into our country.
      We can''t throw them out. And in many cases, they shouldn''t be here. ... They''re
      supposed to come back to court. Almost nobody comes back to court."


      Reality: When deportable immigrants are arrested, some go into mandatory detention
      and some have to be released. Immigration officials have discretion on the rest.
      The US has the capacity to detain only roughly 40,000 immigrants at any given
      time, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and congressional appropriators,
      and in this administration and the last, many immigrants who are deemed not
      to be flight risks and not dangerous are released on their own recognizance
      or with monitoring technology.


      The Trump administration has expressed frustration in recent days with measures
      in the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and a 2015 court
      ruling on what''s known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, a court case that
      goes back decades. Both created protections for children in immigration custody.
      Unaccompanied minors from non-neighboring countries must be turned over to the
      Department of Health and Human Services for resettlement within three days of
      arrest, as opposed to being held in lengthy detention, and children with their
      families also cannot be held in lengthy detention.


      To respond to that order, the Obama administration began releasing the families
      from detention, as opposed to releasing the children without their parents.
      Trump administration officials have referred to these measures as "loopholes"
      that criminals "exploit," though advocates and supporters say they are human
      rights and constitutional rights protections for vulnerable populations.


      The Trump administration has also been trying to tighten the rights of asylum
      seekers. Asylum is a policy under international law and US law that says noncitizens
      who can show they are likely to be persecuted in their home countries can legally
      stay in the US. If an immigrant tells an officer at the border that they fear
      persecution, they are given a "credible fear" test to determine if they may
      have a claim. Based on US Citizenship and Immigration Services data, the credible
      fear passage rate was nearly 80% in fiscal year 2017, which takes into account
      that these individuals are likely to be traumatized, unfamiliar with US law
      and have little English-language skills.


      Because of a massive backlog in the immigration courts, it can take years for
      those cases to work their way to completion, and many immigrants are given the
      ability to work and live in the US in the meantime, putting down roots.


      According to Justice Department data , 25% of asylum decisions were given in
      absentia in 2016, meaning those immigrants were not in court. That number in
      2015 and 2016 was higher than years previous. Also according to the data, 43%
      of asylum petitions were eventually granted in 2016, a number that continued
      the downward trend of recent years.


      Blaming Congress


      Trump: "Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option
      if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol
      Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don''t allow them to do their
      job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen." ( "Congress must immediately
      pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive
      inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the
      weak Dem laws don''t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country
      is being stolen." ( Tweeted Monday).


      Reality: A bill that represented the White House''s proposal to preserve the
      Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump has ended, would
      not have passed even with the so-called nuclear option -- allowing legislation
      to pass with only a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes it now requires
      to advance bills. A bill that represented the White House''s proposal to preserve

      border security and drastically cutting legal and family-based migration, got
      only 39 votes , including those of three Democrats.


      A bipartisan proposal that picked up eight Republicans and nearly all Democrats
      would have passed in that scenario, getting 54 votes. That bill, which would
      have created a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, given Trump $25 billion
      for border security and put some restrictions on family-based immigration, failed
      to get enough support after the administration aggressively attacked it before
      the votes.'

    text: "(CNN) President Donald Trump, mulling how to end the US role in the Syrian\
      \ conflict while having other countries \"take care of it,\" has maintained\
      \ an unusual fixation: the jumbo jets owned by Persian Gulf monarchs.\n\n\"\
      Without us you wouldn't last two weeks. You'd be overrun. And you'd have to\
      \ fly commercial,\" Trump told one Gulf leader recently in a conversation he\
      \ boasted about later to friends.\n\nAs the President's national security team\
      \ prepares options for Syria, advisers and officials say economic factors --\
      \ rather than a concern for global security -- have animated Trump. Even as\
      \ top US military officials quietly prepare plans that would actually increase\
      \ the number of US troops deployed to Syria, Trump has decided that the time\
      \ has come to cut an early exit, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\
      \nHe's increasingly pressed foreign leaders -- particularly in the oil rich\
      \ Gulf states -- to step up.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the East Room, Trump\
      \ said Tuesday that he and his team were nearing a decision on how to proceed\
      \ in Syria now that ISIS has lost most of its territory.\n\n\"Sometimes it's\
      \ time to come back home. And we're thinking about that very seriously,\" Trump\
      \ said, bemoaning the trillions of dollars spent on wars in the Middle East\
      \ which he said resulted in \"nothing except death and destruction.\"\n\n\"\
      I want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding\
      \ our nation,\" Trump said.\n\nThose were views Trump first aired publicly last\
      \ week during a freewheeling, campaign-style event in Ohio , where Trump inserted\
      \ his declaration that \"we'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon\" into\
      \ a speech that was otherwise focused on a booming US economy.\n\nThe statement\
      \ caused a stir back in Washington, where puzzled Pentagon and State Department\
      \ officials contacted the White House to determine what, precisely, the President's\
      \ position on Syria was.\n\nRecipe for withdrawal\n\nNational security officials\
      \ had been weighing for months the conditions that would need to be met before\
      \ US troops withdraw from the country, where they have helping battle ISIS.\
      \ Military commanders have not recommended to Trump that he order a withdrawal\
      \ of US troops there, citing the persistent presence of ISIS and the power vacuum\
      \ that would result if the US departs.\n\nBut he has insisted in private since\
      \ at least February that he wants out of the country, multiple people familiar\
      \ with the matter said. And he has lamented the expenditure of billions in US\
      \ taxpayers dollars to fund a fight he says should be financed by regional players.\n\
      \nThat's in contrast to members of his own administration, who insist the ISIS\
      \ fight must continue until the terror group is eradicated. While the US and\
      \ its allies on the ground have made massive gains reducing ISIS' territory,\
      \ the grou is entrenched in its remaining strongholds and removing them will\
      \ require continued US involvement, those national security officials have said.\n\
      \nOfficials have also warned Trump that players like Iran, Turkey and Russia\
      \ could use a US withdrawal to advance their own strategic interests in Syria.\
      \ The leaders of those countries -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Turkish\
      \ President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011Fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin --\
      \ are meeting this week in Ankara to discuss further steps in Syria.\n\n\"In\
      \ terms of our campaign in Syria, we are in Syria to fight ISIS. That is our\
      \ mission. And our mission isn't over, and we're going to complete that mission,\"\

      \ the United States Central Command, said Tuesday the \"hard part\" in Syria\
      \ lies ahead while speaking at the same event as McGurk.\n\n\"A lot of very\

      \ said.\n\nWhile Trump's top commanders have each individually said that now\
      \ is not the time to withdraw from Syria, a person close to the White House\
      \ told CNN that Defense Secretary James Mattis has avoided bringing up the issue\
      \ -- beyond the fight against ISIS -- directly with the President.\n\nThat's\
      \ a calculated move on the part of Mattis, who does not want Trump to associate\

      \ -- said the person. The source added there is a view within the White House\

    text: 'Fears of a trade war between the United States and China just escalated
      again.


      The Trump administration on Tuesday published a list of about 1,300 Chinese
      exports that could be targeted for tariffs.


      The United States plans to apply the tariffs to about $50 billion worth of goods
      to punish China for its theft of trade secrets, including software, patents
      and other technology. A 25% tariff would be applied to all the products, according
      to the US Trade Representative, a wing of the White House.


      Many of the tariffs would target the Chinese aerospace, tech and machinery industries.
      Others would target medical equipment, medicine and educational material, such
      as bookbinding equipment.


      In a statement, the Chinese embassy in the United States said that China "strongly
      condemns and firmly opposes" the proposed list.


      "As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate," the embassy
      said, adding that China intends to pursue the matter with the World Trade Organization
      and enact "corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products."


      The tariffs won''t go into effect immediately. The administration will hold
      a public hearing for US businesses on May 15. Even after that, it''s not clear
      when the tariffs would be applied.


      China tariffs: Artificial teeth, flamethrowers and other things on the list


      US business advocates said the administration diagnosed the problem with China
      correctly, but had the wrong remedy.


      "The administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in our
      trade relationship with China. However, imposing taxes on products used daily
      by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends,"
      said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce,
      an advocacy group that has long been opposed to Trump''s trade policy.


      Read the full list of proposed tariffs


      A lobbying group for US farmers pleaded with the administration not to go forward
      with the tariffs, fearing retaliation by China, one of the largest buyers of
      US crops.


      "We continue to urge the administration to listen to farmers across rural America
      who can''t afford new taxes on their exports," Max Baucus, a former Democratic
      senator from Montana and co-chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement.

      The list came hours after China''s Foreign Ministry insisted it would respond
      with equal measure to any US tariffs. China said it has its own list of American
      exports that it will target if the United States goes through with its plan.


      "We have been saying that China wouldn''t start a trade war," a Foreign Ministry
      spokesperson said in Beijing. "But we are not afraid of it, and we will resolutely
      fight to the end if someone insists on a war."


      Leaders from both countries have been in talks for more than a week to try to
      make compromises and provide US companies more rights in China.


      After a months-long investigation, the USTR concluded that China forces US tech
      companies that want to operate there to enter joint ventures with Chinese businesses
      and share their technology. Chinese firms often steal patents and software from
      the American firms, the investigation found.


      Related: How much has the US lost from China''s IP theft?


      There is little dispute in the United States that China does not play by the
      rules when it comes to tech trade. The debate in Washington is about the best
      way to punish China without hurting American consumers.


      The United States had promised that the proposed tariffs would hit Chinese tech,
      aerospace, communications and machinery. But the list released Tuesday includes
      some unexpected items, such as malaria test kits, hearing aids, defibrillators,
      flame throwers, syringes, artificial teeth and X-ray machine equipment.


      The USTR also proposed tariffs on Chinese-made military rifles, shotguns and
      grenade launchers. Turbo jet engines and certain helicopters are among those
      slated in Chinese aerospace to be hit with a duty. Several drilling machines
      are on the list as well.


      The Trump administration has already imposed a 25% tariff on imported steel
      and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum. Those tariffs apply to most countries,
      including China, though some have been exempted.


      China responded to the metal tariffs with its own tariffs on $3 billion of US
      exports to China, including fruits, wine, nuts and pork.'

    text: '(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told special counsel Robert
      Mueller in a classified August 2, 2017, memo that he should investigate allegations
      that President Donald Trump''s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was "colluding
      with Russian government officials" to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,
      prosecutors in the Russia probe revealed late Monday night.


      Mueller was also empowered by Rosenstein to investigate Manafort''s payments
      from Ukrainian politicians, a cornerstone of the Trump adviser''s decades-long
      lobbying career that has resulted in several financial criminal charges so far.


      The revelation of the August 2 memo comes amid a broader court filing from Mueller''s
      prosecutors that offers a full-throated defense of their investigative powers
      and indictments thus far. In the filing, the special counsel''s office argues
      that a federal judge should not throw out Manafort''s case. Manafort has sought
      to have the case dismissed, arguing that the charges against him are outside
      of Mueller''s authority.


      The filing Monday night crystallizes the extent to which Rosenstein, who has
      come under fire by President Donald Trump and others, has backed the investigation''s
      actions. (Rosenstein oversees Mueller''s investigation following Attorney General
      Jeff Sessions'' recusal.)


      The memo, attached to Monday night''s court argument and not previously disclosed
      even to Manafort, describes how Rosenstein''s public order that appointed Mueller
      in May left out some details so it didn''t confirm "specific investigations
      involving specific individuals."

    text: '(CNN) A lawyer for Stormy Daniels is asking the Treasury Department to
      release information filed with the government by a bank about "suspicious" activity
      surrounding the porn star''s hush-money deal with Michael Cohen, President Donald
      Trump''s longtime attorney.


      Michael Avenatti made the request in a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary
      Steve Mnuchin on Monday. A copy of the letter was shared with CNN.


      "We believe it is going to undercut the claims of Mr. Cohen relating to the
      transfer of the money, the flow of the money, and what exactly happened here.
      But the fact that a (suspicious activity report) was filed in this case is a
      big deal and it''s an indication that the bank sees a problem here," Avenatti
      told CNN''s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.


      Avenatti wrote in the letter that the $130,000 payment that Cohen made to Daniels
      is central to her lawsuit against Trump, Cohen and Essential Consultants --
      the company that Cohen established in 2016 to facilitate the transaction. A
      "suspicious activity report," or SAR, was filed by First Republic Bank -- the
      bank Cohen allegedly used to make the payment -- to the Treasury Department,
      the Wall Street Journal reported last month


      The details of the $130,000 payment are not only key to Daniels'' lawsuit, Avenatti
      argued, but also of "great public concern" to the country.

    text: '(CNN) Let''s take this moment to pause and take stock of the jetsam that
      has been jettisoned from President Donald Trump''s Cabinet and compare it with
      what hasn''t.


      Beware the effort to make full sense of the President''s hiring and firing decisions
      or to explain why one person ( Rex Tillerson , for example) doesn''t last, while
      another person ( Scott Pruitt , say) does. So far, at least. Pruitt could be
      gone tomorrow, for all we know.


      But there are some themes worth examining here. Notably, that what seems to
      get a Trump Cabinet official forced out is not scandal but disagreeing with
      the boss.


      That''s why Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and VA Secretary David Shulkin
      were both let go via tweet. They both disagreed with Trump on real policy moves.
      Trump said Tillerson didn''t want to end the Obama-era Iran nuclear agreement.
      Trump does.


      So no hard feelings, but there''s the door.

      Tillerson''s very simple policy dispute with Trump (exacerbated, perhaps, by
      those reports that Tillerson had called Trump a "moron" behind closed doors),
      seems tame compared to the high-flying scandals ensnaring other Cabinet members.


      It''s a wonder Shulkin made it as long as he did; the subject of an IG investigation
      over his travel. But it was a hard policy issue -- how much to privatize the
      health care of veterans -- that ultimately seems to have created an irreparable
      rift between Shulkin and the White House. Now they can''t even agree on whether
      Shulkin was fired or not

      There has been no such rift for EPA administrator Pruitt, despite a string of
      embarrassing stories about his first-class flights, his apparently cozy low-rent
      housing situation courtesy of the spouse of an energy lobbyist, and more.


      If an embarrassing scandal is going to claim a Cabinet secretary, the smart
      money is on Pruitt. But we''ll see.

      For all that, Pruitt still has his job. And he got a call of encouragement from
      the President on Tuesday. Why? Who the heck knows! But with Trump, it''s worth
      mentioning that Pruitt is executing his duties as Trump sees them -- dismantling
      the US regulatory state -- quite well. He announced Tuesday a plan to revisit
      car emissions standards put in place during the Obama presidency.


      Neither Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson nor Education Secretary
      Betsy DeVos appear to have crossed Trump on a policy idea. They both still have
      their jobs, despite some embarrassments. DeVos gave a less-than-stellar interview
      to "60 Minutes." Carson came under fire when his office tried to spend taxpayer
      money on extravagant redecoration of his HUD office. (Trump also might also
      be loath to lose the only African-American member of his Cabinet and one of
      the few women).


      The President wasn''t too torn up about losing Gary Cohn, who was not a Cabinet
      member as director of Trump''s National Economic Council. But Cohn was a principal
      and top policy mind at the White House. He and Trump differed over tariffs the
      President unilaterally enacted on steel and aluminum imports, and then Cohn
      resigned


      Trump never gelled with national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and replaced
      him with John Bolton , who has much more aggressive views on foreign policy,
      in line with Trump''s own.

      There are obviously exceptions. Trump''s first HHS Secretary Tom Price resigned
      under pressure back in September of 2017 during a private plane scandal in which
      he spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on private transportation.


      But other Cabinet secretaries, including Pruitt, Shulkin, Treasury Secretary
      Steven Mnuchin and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke all have had travel issues.


      What helped push Price out the door was his attachment to the failed efforts
      by Republicans to repeal Obamacare. Trump even said during a speech to Boy Scouts
      in July that if Price couldn''t get the votes to repeal Obamacare, he''d be
      gone.


      "He better get them. Oh, he better," Trump said . "Otherwise I''ll say, ''Tom,
      you''re fired.'' "

      Sessions pushes back vs Trump 05:00


      The wild card in all of this is Jeff Sessions, the attorney general who was
      an early and vocal Trump supporter but who Trump now regrets appointing . Sessions''
      big problem is that he blinked in the face of public scrutiny and recused himself
      from any sort of Russia election meddling investigation. That set off the series
      of dominoes that gave us Robert Mueller''s special counsel investigation, which
      has already gotten guilty pleas from former Trump campaign aides and shows few
      signs of slowing down.


      Former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said he had to chase down
      Sessions outside the White House and convince him not to quit at one point.
      Trump has made sport of publicly humiliating Sessions to the point that Sessions
      has pushed back at times. But Sessions seems to have weathered the storm for
      now and is busy carrying out Trump''s hardline immigration policies and engaging
      in political war with California.


      Priebus, by the way, took the fall for a string of legislative failures and
      leaks from the White House. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon was forced
      out after he contradicted Trump on North Korea and overstated his power. Failure
      to enact Trump''s agenda -- or unwillingness to do so due to policy differences
      -- has been the downfall time and again for members of the President''s team.


      So, Sessions and Pruitt are in, for now. And Tillerson and others are out. It''s
      a lesson other Cabinet members might want to learn. They''ll need to keep up
      with the boss if they want to stay put.'

    text: '(CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he''s calling on the military
      to guard the US-Mexico border until his long-promised border wall is complete.


      "I told Mexico, and I respect what they did, I said, look, your laws are very
      powerful, your laws are very strong. We have very bad laws for our border and
      we are going to be doing some things, I spoke with (Defense Secretary James)
      Mattis, we''re going to do some things militarily. Until we can have a wall
      and proper security, we''re going to be guarding our border with the military.
      That''s a big step," he said during a luncheon with leaders of the Baltic states.


      He continued: "We cannot have people flowing into our country illegally, disappearing,
      and by the way never showing up for court."


      Asked to clarify his comments during a joint news conference, Trump said he
      is "preparing for the military to secure our border" and he would be attending
      a meeting on the topic of border security with Mattis and others "in a little
      while."


      Trump has privately floated the idea of funding construction of a border wall
      with Mexico through the US military budget in conversations with advisers, two
      sources confirmed to CNN last week . His remarks Tuesday come on the heels of
      multiple days of hardline immigration rhetoric from the Trump White House, with
      the President calling on Congress to pass strict border laws in a series of
      tweets beginning Sunday.

      fewer environmental regulations and to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

    text: "Washington (CNN) The White House on Tuesday found itself again embroiled\
      \ in the foibles of a Cabinet secretary -- this time Environmental Protection\
      \ Agency head Scott Pruitt, who has come under scrutiny by President Donald\
      \ Trump's aides for living in a $50-per-night apartment owned by a lobbyist\
      \ .\n\nAmid questions about his standing in the administration, Trump phoned\
      \ Pruitt on Monday night and told him to \"keep your head up\" and \"keep fighting,\"\
      \ an administration official said.\n\n\"We got your back,\" Trump told Pruitt,\
      \ according to the official.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly followed\
      \ up with Pruitt on Tuesday morning and reinforced the President's message,\
      \ the official added.\n\nBut the show of solidarity with the embattled environmental\
      \ chief belied deep concerns within the White House about Pruitt's actions,\
      \ which ethics experts have said raises questions about conflict of interests\
      \ in his decisions about approving energy projects and rolling back regulations.\n\
      \nA White House official confirmed that both calls happened, but declined to\
      \ disclose the content of each conversation, leaving in question how fulsomely\
      \ the President backed his EPA head.\n\nTrump himself offered only vague backing\
      \ when questioned about Pruitt's standing during a meeting with Nordic leaders\
      \ at the White House.\n\n\"I hope he's going to be great,\" Trump said Tuesday.\n\
      \nThe White House is \"looking into\" Pruitt's housing situation, a person familiar\
      \ with the matter told CNN on Monday evening. The inquiry, which was described\
      \ more as a review of the situation than a formal inquest, is meant to determine\
      \ if there were any ethics issues or wrongdoing. The White House has not yet\
      \ made a conclusion on the matter.\n\nPruitt rented a room in a condo from Vicki\
      \ and Steven Hart, lobbyists whose firm has lobbied the EPA on behalf of an\
      \ Oklahoma Energy company. Pruitt leased a room for around $50 a night, only\
      \ paying when he stayed there. In total, Pruitt paid $6,100 for the room over\
      \ six months, a rate significantly lower than market value. Pruitt's landlords,\
      \ the Harts, were among his political donors when he was an Oklahoma state official.\n\
      \nCabinet d\xE9j\xE0 vu\n\nOfficials described a sense of d\xE9j\xE0 vu inside\
      \ the West Wing as they grapple with a raft of new allegations against Pruitt\
      \ -- just the latest of Trump's Cabinet officials to face ethics and legal questions.\
      \ Similar scenarios played out before Trump dismissed Health and Human Services\
      \ Secretary Tom Price and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin: aides are\
      \ scrambling to sort out what is real and what isn't; they are demanding answers\
      \ from Pruitt and the EPA; and they're bracing for Trump's inevitable fury at\
      \ the negative headlines.\n\nTrump has not indicated that he's ready to dismiss\
      \ Pruitt, officials said, and his phone call on Tuesday reinforced -- for now\
      \ -- the impression that Pruitt is temporarily secure in his job. But Trump\
      \ is known to change course quickly, and there was little optimism inside the\
      \ White House that Pruitt's standing would remain on solid ground.\n\nTrump\
      \ also reportedly held an upbeat phone call with Shulkin shortly before the\
      \ top Veterans Affairs official was let go.\n\nResponding to reports about Pruitt's\
      \ shaky footing with the President, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox hailed Pruitt's\
      \ accomplishments in a statement on Monday evening.\n\n\"From advocating to\
      \ leave the Paris Accord, working to repeal Obama's Clean Power Plan and WOTUS,\
      \ and cleaning up toxic Superfund sites that have been languishing for decades,\
      \ Administrator Pruitt is focused on advancing President Trump's agenda of regulatory\
      \ certainty and environmental stewardship,\" Wilcox said.\n\nPolicy agenda moving\
      \ forward\n\nTrump has not identified a replacement for Pruitt should he decide\
      \ to fire him, multiple senior officials said, and he remains enthusiastic about\
      \ the progress his EPA has made toward deregulation and environmental rollbacks.\n\
      \nThat, officials said, could make the difference for Pruitt, who is liked by\
      \ the President. Previously fired officials such as Shulkin and Secretary of\
      \ State Rex Tillerson failed to develop chemistry with the commander in chief,\
      \ exacerbating their agencies' troubles and sealing their respective demises.\
      \ But Trump is much fonder of Pruitt, and even recently floated him as a potential\
      \ replacement for Jeff Sessions at the Justice Department\n\nPruitt's aides\
      \ took advantage of that suggestion, heavily pushing it to reporters, which\
      \ irked Sessions's allies in the administration, who pointed out that the President\
      \ often floats several people a day for jobs that aren't available.\n\nOn Tuesday,\
      \ Pruitt openly flattered Trump amid reports that he is on shaky ground.\n\n\
      \"This is another step in the President's regulatory agenda -- de-regulatory\
      \ agenda, regulatory certainty, as Peter indicated, a billion dollars in savings\
      \ with respect to over 22 significant regulatory actions that we've been involved\
      \ in here at the agency,\" he said at an event at the EPA.\n\n\"This President\
      \ has shown tremendous courage to say to the American people that America is\
      \ going to be put first,\" he added.\n\nOne official at the White House described\
      \ Pruitt as taking extra steps to curry favor with Trump, including suggesting\
      \ tacking on additional import restrictions onto a review of fuel efficiency\
      \ regulations as a way to strengthen the administration's aggressive stance\
      \ on tariffs and trade.\n\nThe drafted restrictions would be unrealistic, according\
      \ to this official, but Pruitt tried to \"package it for the President so that\
      \ it looks that way.\"\n\n\"He is trying so hard to please the President,\"\
      \ the official said.\n\nAides suggested if Trump does replace Pruitt this week,\
      \ it would be a much speedier timeline than occurred before the departures of\
      \ Shulkin, Tillerson or national security adviser H.R. McMaster, all whom Trump\
      \ let twist in the wind for weeks, if not months.\n\nFor his part, Pruitt was\
      \ maintaining his schedule of events, albeit in a modified fashion. He announced\
      \ new fuel standards at an event at EPA headquarters in downtown Washington,\
      \ revealing little of the internal tumult which has gripped his agency.\n\n\
      He was originally planning to deliver the announcement at a Chevrolet dealership\
      \ in Chantilly, Virginia, but the owner of the dealership, Jeff Pohanka, told\
      \ CNN on Monday evening that the event had been canceled."

      Russia and the 2016 presidential race, it''s that there was no collusion between
      any member of his campaign and Russian intelligence officials.


      Asked in January about the possibility of sitting down with special counsel
      Bob Mueller to discuss Russia and the election, Trump unleashed this gem (bolding
      is mine):


      "There has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians or Trump

      In short: No collusion. In long: No collusion.


      Trump has called Mueller''s exploration of possible collusion with the Russians
      a "witch hunt" and a "hoax." It''s part of a broader PR campaign pursued by
      the President, his legal team and his loyalists to cast the special counsel

    text: 'Washington (CNN) After months of wavering, President Donald Trump finally
      decided in mid-March to get rid of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- and he
      did so in a fashion that heightened discord both outside the White House and
      within.


      Chief of staff John Kelly -- hoping to disprove the endless headlines declaring
      the West Wing was in chaos -- was furious when Trump discarded his suggestion
      to make the announcement during a traditional White House ceremony.


      Trump, meanwhile, wasn''t in a waiting mood. He refused to promise he would
      wait until Tillerson had returned from Africa to announce his decision. And
      he rebuffed Kelly''s recommendation that he meet with Tillerson and Tillerson''s
      replacement, Mike Pompeo, in the Oval Office.


      Kelly hurriedly phoned the secretary of state, suffering from an illness in
      Kenya, to warn him that the President was ready to announce his ouster. He suggested
      he return home quickly. Hours after Tillerson landed at Joint Base Andrews,
      the tweet arrived.


      The episode, recounted by a senior official familiar with the proceedings, offers
      a glimpse into the disorderly manner Trump has adopted as he works to shape
      his Cabinet and senior staff to his liking. As he continues to shed advisers
      he''s deemed insufficiently aligned with his agenda, he''s ignored the advice
      of his senior-most aides to try and mitigate the appearance of disarray. Instead,
      he''s heightened the sense that his administration is lurching from one firing
      to the next by dispatching tweets announcing his decisions as they happen, and
      discarding advice to formalize his personnel announcements.


      The White House did not respond to a request for comment.


      His own best adviser


      JUST WATCHED Trump blames Democrats for DACA ending Replay More Videos ... MUST
      WATCH Trump blames Democrats for DACA ending 02:54


      People familiar with his thinking say Trump has renewed his longtime conviction
      that he is his best adviser, listening principally to his own instincts as he
      navigates the presidency. While frustrated by the outside impression that he
      is overseeing a tumultuous administration, Trump has in reality openly admitted
      that he prefers chaos to a staid sense of order.


      Kelly has seen his influence steadily waning, people familiar with the matter
      say, even as Trump has shown no signs he''s ready to dismiss him. One person
      familiar with Kelly''s thinking described the retired Marine general as viewing
      his job like a battlefield commander, with a patriotic duty to remain on board.


      As Trump enters a new phase of his White House tenure, there is widespread assumption
      among his aides that the impulsive moves which have colored the past several
      weeks will continue. Lacking key advisers who sometimes acted as moderating
      forces -- such as communications director Hope Hicks, staff secretary Rob Porter
      and National Economic Council chairman Gary Cohn -- Trump is expected to make
      decisions from his gut, with few voices able to guide him otherwise. Top advisers
      Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the President''s son-in-law and daughter, do
      not seem to be major forces of influence at this point.


      Aides often become frustrated with the President''s short attention span. One
      official described Trump as frequently meandering from the topic at hand in
      meetings, particularly if he believes the positions being aired by his advisers
      differ from his own point of view. He''ll stall sessions with non-sequiturs,
      complaining at random about Amazon''s tax status or proclaiming that he''s only
      visited Russia once, for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.


      A boss who cares little for policy memos or rollout plans, Trump has focused
      more on the attendant media coverage of his decisions than on the choreography
      of announcing them, people familiar with the matter said. He has remained preoccupied
      with the Russia investigation and has lately grown concerned that his base believes
      he''s softened on immigration, matters which have agitated him and driven some
      of his recent rash decisions, according to the sources.


      During a long weekend at his Florida estate, Trump heard from a parade of conservative
      voices that his base is beginning to question his commitment to tough immigration
      reforms. The conversations -- including with Fox News personalities -- led to
      an storm of angry tweets on the matter.


      Partly fueling the outburst: Trump''s notice of outspoken conservative commentator
      Ann Coulter , who has taken her disappointment with Trump public in recent weeks,
      including on the Fox airwaves. As he approaches this year''s midterm elections,
      Trump has openly expressed concern that lack of progress on building a border
      wall could harm Republican prospects.


      He''s huddled with longtime political advisers, such as former campaign aides
      Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, to formulate plans for his appearances on
      the campaign trail in the coming months. At the same time, he''s reminisced
      fondly about the freewheeling days from his own campaign, which have not been
      replicated during his time in office.


      Only one campaign original remains in the White House: Dan Scavino, the social
      media director who recently moved into Hicks'' old office , a few paces from
      the President''s desk. Trump has openly wondered how he''ll operate without
      Hicks around and staffers admit there''s little certainty about what the departure
      might mean for Trump''s mood.


      Decisions on the fly


      JUST WATCHED Sen. Sasse: Trump''s call to Putin weakened US Replay More Videos
      ... MUST WATCH Sen. Sasse: Trump''s call to Putin weakened US 01:57


      Proclamations over the past month to impose new steel tariffs and open talks
      with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un demonstrated Trump''s penchant for making
      decisions on the fly, even with supposed guardrails like Hicks and Cohn in place.
      The moves sent aides scrambling to execute their boss''s commands and, in some
      cases, sending the stock market plummeting.


      In past administrations, the nomination or retirement of a Cabinet secretary
      was typically a highly staged affair, marked with an in-person statement from
      the President himself, along with remarks from the outgoing secretary and a
      statement from the person chosen as a replacement. Such ceremonies were formal
      events, held in the White House East Room or Rose Garden, with family members
      of the nominees or retirees sitting in the front row.


      Trump, whose splits with Tillerson and recently departed Veterans Affairs Secretary
      David Shulkin were preceded by months of acrimony, has announced few of his
      personnel decisions in person. Instead, he''s used Twitter to declare when he''s
      ready to change around his staff.


      That''s made it difficult for his aides to predict when, precisely, the announcements
      will be made. In the lead-up to Trump''s statement that national security adviser
      H.R. McMaster would be departing, White House aides repeatedly insisted the
      two men enjoyed a good working relationship and that no staffing changes were
      coming to the National Security Council.


      Similarly, aides were left to tap dance when questioned about Shulkin''s standing
      after it was widely reported that Trump had decided to dismiss him. After days
      of uncertainty, Trump finally tweeted he was replacing the embattled VA chief
      with Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician.


      As with his decisions to install John Bolton as national security adviser, Pompeo
      as secretary of state and Larry Kudlow as chief economist, the decision to elevate
      Jackson reflected Trump''s desire to surround himself with known entities who
      have demonstrated a willingness to agree with the President on policy and political
      matters.


      But the rollout of Shulkin''s firing raised questions about what planning went
      into the White House moves. An administration official said on Monday that Shulkin
      called Kelly last Wednesday morning, asking how the press team at the VA should
      respond to inquiries from reporters who said they were being told Trump would
      fire him on Twitter that afternoon. Kelly then spoke with the President, who
      said he was indeed planning on announcing Jackson as Shulkin''s replacement.
      Trump asked Kelly how he thought it should be carried out.


      Kelly told the President he would call Shulkin to inform him of Trump''s intentions.
      It was during that phone call that Kelly offered Shulkin the opportunity to
      resign, which he did, according to this official.


      Shulkin, however, has insisted he did not resign.


      "I came to run the Department of Veterans Affairs because I''m committed to
      veterans, and I''m committed to fighting for them," Shulkin told CNN''s Jake
      Tapper on "State of the Union" Sunday. "And I would not resign, because I''m
      committed to making sure this job was seen through to the very end."'

    text: 'President Donald Trump is the Michael Jordan of name-calling, seemingly
      upping the ante of what''s possible in the nickname sphere with each passing
      week.


      On Tuesday morning, Trump added another -- "Cheatin'' Obama" -- in reference
      to his immediate predecessor in the White House. It''s not clear what exactly
      where Obama was "cheatin''," but it doesn''t matter! It''s a nickname! It doesn''t
      have to make sense!


      Where does the latest nickname fit in my definitive rankings of Trump''s nicknames
      for his political enemies? Good question! Scroll down.


      17. "Weak Laws Border": Lost in his "Cheatin'' Obama" attack on Tuesday was
      the fact that Trump gave an inanimate object a nickname. I reached out to the
      border to see if it had any comment on being called "weak." I''ll update this
      post if it responds.


      16. "Jeff Flakey": I mean, all Trump did was add a "y" to the end of Arizona
      Sen. Jeff Flake''s name. Pretty low on creativity points. Also, I bet Flake
      never heard his last name made fun of like this before Trump did it.


      15. "Dicky Durbin": On the plus side, adding that "y" to the Illinois senator''s
      first name has the effect of infantalizing him, which was clearly Trump''s goal.
      On the other, simply adding a "y" to a guy''s first name feels like a bit of
      a missed opportunity when said guy''s name is "Dick Durbin."


      14. "Little Adam Schiff": Of all the "little/liddle"-based nicknames, this one,
      : Of all the "little/liddle"-based nicknames, this one, which comes from a February
      tweet , feels the weakest. Schiff is 5''10". Meh.


      13. "Liddle Bob Corker": If "Little Marco" had never existed, this shot at the
      Tennessee Republican Senator would have ranked higher. But, you can''t close
      Pandora''s box. Or put the genie back in the bottle. Or something.


      12. "Cheatin'' Obama": This feels like a missed opportunity for alliteration
      for me. Wouldn''t "Out There Obama" work better? Or "Oily Obama"? That said,
      I do like "Cheatin''" Obama better than "Cheating Obama."


      11. "Cryin'' Chuck Schumer": Every time I hear this one about the Senate Minority
      Leader, I do laugh. At the same time, Trump has known Schumer for decades --
      they are both New Yorkers -- so the bar for greatness is a little higher.


      10. "Al Frankenstien": In terms of a junior high school ethos, it''s hard to
      beat this one. Extra points for the misspelling of "Frankenstein."


      9. "1 for 38 Kasich": This moniker for the governor of Ohio is deeply, deeply
      underappreciated. A dig on Kasich''s lack of wins during the Republican primary
      season that takes waaaaay longer to say than "John Kasich"? I''m all in. : This
      moniker for the governor of Ohio is deeply, deeply underappreciated. A dig on
      Kasich''s lack of wins during the Republican primary season that takes waaaaay
      longer to say than "John Kasich"? I''m all in.


      8. "Sneaky Dianne": I like it, but I don''t love it. It feels derivative of
      "Crooked Hillary" -- and Sen. Dianne Feinstein deserves better.


      7. "Crooked Hillary": This was solid, for sure. For lots of voters, it summed
      up what they didn''t like about Clinton: The perception that she didn''t think
      the rules applied to her. But, I grade this nickname down a bit because there
      were SO many options available for Trump when it came to Clinton that "Crooked"
      feels only so-so. Couldn''t he have thrown some alliteration in there?


      6. "Sloppy Steve": A quality one here about former Trump adviser Steve Bannon
      -- : A quality one here about former Trump adviser Steve Bannon -- in his many-layered
      splendor . Bannon''s resistance to shaving and hair cuts doesn''t help -- or
      does help, depending on how you look at it.


      5. "Little Marco": There was a time during 2016 that this one was my favorite.
      While it wasn''t strictly accurate -- Rubio is not particularly short -- it
      stuck because it had the added meaning that the Florida senator was just sort
      of a minor player. Not a big enough character to hold the national stage. "Little
      Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the
      ''puppet'' of the special interest Koch brothers," : There was a time during
      2016 that this one was my favorite. While it wasn''t strictly accurate -- Rubio
      is not particularly short -- it stuck because it had the added meaning that
      the Florida senator was just sort of a minor player. Not a big enough character
      to hold the national stage. "Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator
      from Florida, is set to be the ''puppet'' of the special interest Koch brothers,"
      tweeted Trump in February 2016 . "WATCH!" I will!


      4. "Pocahontas": Offensive? Absolutely. Hard to forget? Also yes. Trump''s nickname
      for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, has its genesis in her
      claim that she had Native American heritage -- : Offensive? Absolutely. Hard
      to forget? Also yes. Trump''s nickname for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren,
      a Democrat, has its genesis in her claim that she had Native American heritage
      -- 1/32nd to be exact . The claim became an issue in Warren''s 2012 Senate campaign,
      but she still easily beat incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown. If Warren runs
      in 2020 -- and she is certainly thinking about it -- get ready to hear "Pocahontas"
      a whole lot more.


      3. "Low Energy" Jeb: Like all of Trump''s best nicknames, this one had the ring
      of truth. Jeb(!) was a low-key presence on the campaign trail at a time when
      people wanted a candidate to take a flamethrower to the nation''s capital. That
      the nickname also doubled as a not-that-subtle shot at Jeb''s masculinity and
      virility was not by accident. That it clearly irritated Bush made it even better
      (for Trump).


      2. "Lyin'' Ted": I can''t tell if this nickname is really that good or I am
      simply biased toward it because I heard it so many times during the 2016 Republican
      primary campaign. What I do know is this nickname very much stuck to the Texas
      Senator, encapsulating for lots of people what they didn''t trust about him.
      "He holds up the Bible and then he lies," ": I can''t tell if this nickname
      is really that good or I am simply biased toward it because I heard itduring
      the 2016 Republican primary campaign. What I do know is this nickname very much
      stuck to the Texas Senator, encapsulating for lots of people what they didn''t
      trust about him. "He holds up the Bible and then he lies," Trump told CNN''s
      Anderson Cooper last year.


      1. "Little Rocket Man": Put aside the potential for nuclear annihilation inherent
      in taunting the unstable dictator of a rogue regime and it''s just hard to beat
      this one. Insulting and fitting all in one.'

    text: 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump declared "nobody has been tougher
      on Russia" during a meeting with the heads of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
      to the White House on Tuesday, while also repeating his desire to have a good
      relationship with President Vladimir Putin.


      The declaration comes as tension between Russia and the United States has ratcheted
      up in recent weeks and as Trump met with the Baltic leaders who have grown deeply
      skeptical of Putin in recent years.


      Trump, throughout the Baltic leaders'' time at the White House, maintained that
      he had come down hard on Russia for a series of transgressions. But even his
      tough talk contained conciliatory remarks about Putin, a familiar posture for
      the President.


      "Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said during
      a luncheon with the three leaders. "Now maybe we will and maybe we won''t. Probably
      nobody''s been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump."


      Trump added that "just about everyone agrees" getting along with Russia is a
      good thing "except very stupid people."

    text: "(CNN) It doesn't matter how farfetched it seems, nor does the math seem\
      \ to bother him. President Donald Trump continues to be obsessed with Republicans\
      \ invoking the \"nuclear option\" in the Senate.\n\nHe again goaded Republican\
      \ leaders to change Senate rules and push his immigration agenda through Congress.\
      \ (Note: Invoking the \"nuclear option,\" in the overheated parlance of Washington,\
      \ is using 51 votes to change Senate rules so you don't need 60 votes to cut\
      \ off debate on bills anymore.) This has already been done for executive and\
      \ judicial branch nominees, but not for legislation.\n\nGoing nuclear is a specific\
      \ thing Trump wants. Less clear is what piece of legislation, exactly, he'd\
      \ like to pass.\n\nHe's grumbled about the filibuster at least six times as\
      \ President, saying it's stepped in the way of his agenda on health care, the\
      \ military and immigration policy.\n\nA sampling:\n\n\"With the ridiculous Filibuster\
      \ Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather\
      \ than 51. Can't get votes, END NOW!\" he tweeted September 15 as Republicans\
      \ cast about, ultimately in vain, for a way to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\
      \nHe said something similar in August of that year.\n\n\"If Senate Republicans\
      \ don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will\
      \ be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!\"\n\nMore recently, his rhetoric has\
      \ changed. He's not talking about health care or budget bills with regard to\
      \ the filibuster, but rather immigration and his promised border wall. He sounds\
      \ more urgent, too. He's tweeted three times about the \"nuclear option\" since\
      \ January (and twice in two days in April).\n\nApril 2: \" ...Congress must\
      \ immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop\
      \ the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are\
      \ GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job. Act now Congress,\
      \ our country is being stolen!\n\nAnd a day earlier, with even more all caps:\
      \ \"Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border\
      \ because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting\
      \ more dangerous. \"Caravans\" coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option\
      \ to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\n\nTrump has tweeted about the\
      \ filibuster and the nuclear option at odd times, considering it might not even\
      \ help him achieve what he's tweeting about.\n\nRepublicans couldn't get the\
      \ simple majority for their Obamacare repeal effort in the Senate under budget\
      \ reconciliation rules.\n\nAnd as CNN's Manu Raju pointed out, Trump's own immigration\
      \ plan got only 39 votes when it came up in the Senate recently. The nuclear\
      \ option wouldn't have helped that bill. Not one bit.\n\nAs Trump today and\
      \ yesterday renews call for nuclear option lowering threshold to clear filibuster\
      \ to a simple majority, reminder that his own immigration plan failed with just\
      \ 39 votes in February. https://t.co/w5LVhaxX4Y \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) April\
      \ 2, 2018\n\nSenators end up doing a lot of simple math, as trying to get to\
      \ 60 votes on anything is extremely difficult, which is a large part of the\
      \ reason so little seems to get done on Capitol Hill.\n\nNo Democrat is going\
      \ to want to sign on to giving away their only real means of standing in the\
      \ way of Trump and his agenda. And for Republicans who might want to just do\
      \ away with it, it's important to remember that a Democrat, Harry Reid, first\
      \ invoked the nuclear option in 2013. It was a slippery slope to Republicans,\
      \ under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, using the nuclear option to confirm\
      \ Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year.\n\nEvery single one of the 51\
      \ current Republican senators would have have to sign on to the idea of changing\
      \ Senate rules with a simple majority.\n\nIt's just not going to happen in the\
      \ current Senate. Why? There's a filibuster-proof majority of senators -- 61\
      \ of them! -- who went on the record in April 2017 and signed Maine Republican\
      \ Sen. Susan Collins' letter to Senate leaders asking them not to change Senate\
      \ rules any more.\n\nWhen Trump floated the idea of invoking the nuclear option\
      \ back in January, a spokesman for McConnell repeated that he had no intention\
      \ of doing so.\n\nAll that said, from an expansive historical view, senators\
      \ have been slowly checking their own abilities to stymie legislation and appointments\
      \ for decades.\n\nThe Senate historical office charts some of the inflection\
      \ points , including a threat in 1841 to change Senate rules that allowed for\
      \ unlimited debate. The change to rules in 1917 that created the modern filibuster\
      \ but required 67 votes to do so. The ugly 60-day filibuster of the Civil Rights\
      \ Act in the 1960s. The changing of Senate rules to make it easier to cut off\
      \ debate with only 60 votes in 1975.\n\nYou see where this is going, right?\n\
      \nIt might not happen today or tomorrow, but when the rules were changed by\
      \ Democrats to get more judicial nominees confirmed for President Barack Obama,\
      \ that's when the Senate most recently went nuclear. And we've been living in\
      \ a post-nuclear Senate world since 2013. Republicans carried on the tradition\
      \ by going nuclear to get Gorsuch confirmed. The power is there and senators\
      \ have used it. It's not crazy to think that someday, perhaps soon, when the\
      \ majority party really wants to pass something, they'll change the rules to\
      \ do it. Unfortunately for Trump, the bills he's groused about haven't even\
      \ had a simple majority. Also, the Senate changes very slowly. Until it doesn't."

    text: "Newly uncovered text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa\
      \ Page suggest a possible coordination between high-ranking officials at the\
      \ Obama White House, CIA, FBI, Justice Department and former Senate Democratic\
      \ leadership in the early stages of the investigation into alleged collusion\
      \ between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to GOP congressional investigators\
      \ on Wednesday.\n\nThe investigators say the information provided to Fox News\
      \ \u201Cstrongly\u201D suggests coordination between former President Barack\
      \ Obama\u2019s Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, then-Senate Democratic Leader\
      \ Harry Reid, and CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 which they say would \u201C\
      contradict\u201D the Obama administration\u2019s public stance about its hand\
      \ in the process.\n\nPage texted Strzok on Aug. 2, 2016, saying: \u201CMake\
      \ sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress,\
      \ foia, etc. You probably know better than me.\u201D\n\nA text message from\
      \ Strzok to Page on Aug. 3 described former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\
      \ as being concerned with \u201Cinformation control\u201D related to the initial\
      \ investigation into the Trump campaign. According to a report from the New\
      \ York Times, Brennan was sent to Capitol Hill around the same time to brief\
      \ members of Congress on the possibility of election interference.\n\nDays later,\
      \ on Aug. 8, 2016, Strzok texted Page: \u201CInternal joint cyber cd intel piece\
      \ for D, scenesetter for McDonough brief, Trainor [head of FBI cyber division]\
      \ directed all cyber info be pulled. I\u2019d let Bill and Jim hammer it out\
      \ first, though it would be best for D to have it before the Wed WH session.\u201D\
      \n\nIn the texts, \u201CD\u201D referred to FBI Director James Comey, and and\
      \ \u201CMcDonough\u201D referred to Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, the GOP\
      \ investigators said.\n\n\u201CWe are not making conclusions. What we are saying\
      \ is that the timeline is concerning enough to warrant the appointment of an\
      \ independent investigator to look at whether or not the Obama White House was\
      \ involved [in the Trump-Russia investigation],\u201D a GOP congressional source\
      \ told Fox News.\n\nAn FBI spokesman did not immediately respond to Fox News'\
      \ request for comment.\n\nThe congressional investigators pointed out to Fox\
      \ News that the CIA and FBI are supposed to be \u201Cindependent agencies,\u201D\
      \ and noted that \u201Ccoordination between political actors at the White House\
      \ and investigators would be inappropriate,\u201D raising questions about the\
      \ level of involvement of Obama White House officials.\n\nBut weeks later, on\
      \ August 25, 2016, Brennan went to Capitol Hill to brief Harry Reid \u2014 and\
      \ it was unclear whether FBI officials attended the briefing, a congressional\
      \ source told Fox News.\n\nTwo days after the briefing, Reid penned a letter\
      \ to Comey requesting an investigation into potential collusion between the\
      \ Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n\u201CThe evidence of a direct connection between\
      \ the Russian government and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign continues\
      \ to mount and has led Michael Morrell, the former Acting Central Intelligence\
      \ Director, to call Trump an \u2018unwitting agent\u2019 of Russia and the Kremlin,\u201D\
      \ Reid, a Nevada Democrat, wrote. \u201CThe prospect of a hostile government\
      \ actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of\
      \ the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War and it is critical\
      \ for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use every resource available to\
      \ investigate this matter thoroughly and in a timely fashion.\u201D\n\nReid\
      \ cited reports in his letter, noting \u201Cmethods\u201D Russia was using to\
      \ influence the Trump campaign and \u201Cmanipulate it as a vehicle for advancing\
      \ the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201D\n\nReid added that\
      \ \u201Crecent staff changes within the Trump campaign have made clear that\
      \ the Trump campaign has employed a number of individuals with significant and\
      \ disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin,\u201D urging Comey to make the\
      \ investigation \u201Cpublic.\u201D\n\nThe New York Times first reported on\
      \ Reid\u2019s letter to Comey on Aug. 29, 2016.\n\nThe following day, Aug. 30,\
      \ 2016, Strzok texted Page: \u201CHere we go,\u201D sending a link to the Times\
      \ report titled, \u201CHarry Reid Cites Evidence of Russian Tampering in U.S.\
      \ Vote and seeks FBI inquiry.\u201D\n\nStrzok replied: \u201CD [Comey] said\
      \ at am brief that Reid called him and told him he would be sending a letter.\u201D\
      \n\nCongressional investigators suggested that the Reid letter possibly provided\
      \ \u201Ccover\u201D for the fact that the FBI and Justice Department had already\
      \ begun investigating the Trump campaign in mid-July on what they called \u201C\
      questionable ethical and legal grounds.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe \u2018here we go\u2019\
      \ text between Strzok and Page indicates the FBI/ DOJ knew the letter from Reid\

    text: 'President Trump on Wednesday shared four photos of construction work along
      the U.S.-Mexico border, a day after reports surfaced that he''d suggested using
      military funds to pay for his long-promised border wall.


      Trump tweeted that he had received a "Great briefing this afternoon on the start
      of our Southern Border WALL!" It was not immediately clear who else participated
      in the briefing.


      Department of Homeland Security officials told Fox News the pictures Trump tweeted
      were taken as recently as March 15 in Calexico, Calif., some 120 miles east
      of San Diego. That same week, Trump traveled to San Diego to review border wall
      prototypes in San Diego.


      According to the Border Patrol, crews in Calexico are working on replacing a
      2.25-mile barrier with a "30-foot-high bollard-style wall."


      "Wall in this area was built in the 1990s out of recycled scraps of metal and
      old landing mat," the statement said. "Although the existing wall has proven
      effective at deterring unlawful cross-border activity, smuggling organizations
      damaged and breached this outdated version of a border wall several hundred
      times during the last two years, resulting in costly repairs."


      Over the weekend, Trump raised the possibility of using Pentagon funding on
      the wall after Congress passed a $1.3 trillion omnibus lspending package ast
      week.


      "Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring
      into our country, is all about National Defense," the president tweeted Sunday,
      adding, "Build WALL through M!"


      The omnibus only directed $1.6 billion to the border wall, with a focus on repairs
      and additions to existing fencing. The president initially requested $18 billion
      in wall funding.

    text: 'President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to replace
      Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin with Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, now
      the physician to the president.


      It marked the latest in a string of swift White House replacements in recent
      months. Trump also announced that Robert Wilkie, the undersecretary of defense
      for personnel and readiness, would serve as interim VA secretary, pending Jackson''s
      confirmation.


      The president tweeted that he was "thankful for Dr. David Shulkin''s service
      to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!"


      Jackson has served as the physician to the president since 2013 and gained a
      national profile earlier this year for holding a sweeping press conference on
      Trump''s health.


      The VA is government''s second-largest department, responsible for nine million
      military veterans in more than 1,700 government-run health facilities. The selection
      of Wilkie bypasses VA Deputy Secretary Tom Bowman, who has come under criticism
      for being too moderate to push Trump''s agenda of fixing veterans'' care.


      Rumors had been swirling for weeks about Shulkin''s future amid investigations
      into alleged spending abuses and reports of internal dissension at the VA. In
      February, the VA''s internal watchdog found that Shulkin had improperly accepted
      Wimbledon tennis tickets and his then-chief of staff had doctored emails to
      justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at taxpayer expense. Shulkin agreed
      to reimburse the government more than $4,000 in that case.


      Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., a Marine combat veteran who called for Shulkin to
      resign after the February watchdog report, said in a statement on Wednesday
      that Shulkin had done "nothing to clean up the culture of bureaucratic incompetence
      that has defined the leadership at the VA."


      A separate VA watchdog investigation, due out in the coming weeks, is looking
      into a complaint that Shulkin asked his security detail to accompany him to
      a Home Depot store and cart furniture items, according to two people familiar
      with the allegation who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.


      Shulkin attributed internal drama at the agency to a half-dozen or so political
      appointees who were rebelling against him and Bowman, insisting he had White
      House backing to fire them.


      As recently as Monday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News that
      Trump still had confidence in Shulkin "at this point in time."


      That same day, Shulkin -- the lone Obama administration official in Trump''s
      Cabinet -- abruptly backed out of a scheduled media availability at a VA Medical
      Center in Delaware, telling organizers that he needed to "get back on the road
      to Washington."


      A major veterans'' organization expressed concern over the Shulkin dismissal
      and Trump''s intention to nominate Jackson, whom they worried lacked experience
      to run the huge department.




      "We are disappointed and already quite concerned about this nominee," said Joe
      Chenelly, the national executive director of AMVETS. "The administration needs
      to be ready to prove that he''s qualified to run such a massive agency, a $200
      billion bureaucracy."


      Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised Jackson''s nomination as "a homerun [sic]
      pick" who would "provide the highest quality health care and services to our
      wonderful veterans."


      Having pushed through legislation in Trump''s first year making it easier to
      fire bad VA employees and speed disability appeals, Shulkin stgill leaves behind
      a department in disarray. Several projects remain unfinished, including a multibillion-dollar
      overhaul of electronic medical records aimed at speeding up wait times for veterans
      seeking medical care as well as expanded mental health treatment for vets at
      elevated risk of suicide.


      Concerned Veterans for America Executive Director Dan Caldwell said in a statement
      that Shulkin "made significant headway in reforming the department, but ultimately
      became a distraction from the important task of improving health care for our
      veterans.


      "We are hopeful that this change will end the recent distractions at the VA
      and put the focus back on advancing policy that will ensure veterans get the
      health care and other benefits they have earned," Caldwell added.


      During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged to fix the VA, which
      was still reeling after a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center, in
      which veterans waited months for care even as VA employees created secret waiting
      lists to cover up delays.


      Criticizing the department as "the most corrupt," Trump said he would bring
      accountability and expand access to private doctors, promising to triple the
      number of veterans "seeing the doctor of their choice."


      Currently, more than 30 percent of VA appointments are made in the private sector.


      Shulkin is the second Cabinet secretary to depart over controversies involving
      expensive travel, following former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price''s
      resignation last September.


      In addition, the president announced earlier this month he would replace Secretary
      of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

      \ about Shulkin.\n\nHe was a holdover from the Obama administration\n\nIn 2015,\
      \ former President Barack Obama tapped Shulkin to be under secretary for health\
      \ at the VA.\n\nAfter he was confirmed by the Senate, he served in this role\
      \ for 18 months, \u201Cleading the nation\u2019s largest integrated health care\
      \ system, with over 1,700 sites of care serving nearly nine million Veterans,\u201D\
      \ according to his official Veterans Affairs biography.\n\nAs secretary, Shulkin\
      \ oversaw the entire $177-billion agency, according to the Military Times.\n\
      \nWhen he was serving as secretary, Shulkin said he wanted to \u201Cgive veterans\
      \ greater choice in how and where they receive their care and services and modernize\
      \ the VA system with contemporary facilities, systems and management practices,\u201D\
      \ adding that \u201Creducing veteran suicide was [his] top clinical priority.\u201D\
      \ (A 2016 study from the VA found that some 20 veterans in the U.S. commit suicide\
      \ each day).\n\nShulkin said the VA works closely with community partners, such\
      \ as the #bethere campaign, a suicide prevention and support program targeted\
      \ at veterans. The VA is also working on \u201Cexpanding access to behavioral\
      \ health services and the use of predictive analytics,\" he added.\n\nHe\u2019\
      s a doctor\n\nShulkin received his medical degree from the Medical College of\
      \ Pennsylvania, according to his biography. He later became a medical intern\
      \ at Yale University and then a resident at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\
      Before working in the Department of Veterans Affairs, Shulkin was chief medical\
      \ officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, Temple University\
      \ Hospital and also the Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital, his biography\
      \ states.\n\nHe was also president and CEO of New York's Beth Israel Medical\
      \ Center from 2005 to 2009, according to ABC News.\n\nShulkin crossed medicine\
      \ with business when he founded DoctorQuality, \u201Cone of the first consumer-oriented\
      \ sources of information on quality and safety in healthcare,\u201D according\
      \ to his biography.\n\nAdditionally, Shulkin\u2019s wife, Merle Bari, with whom\
      \ he has two children, is a dermatologist in Philadelphia.\n\nShulkin said his\
      \ experience running private sector organizations in the past helped him to\
      \ bring a \"new approach to government.\"\n\n\u201CI've been a CEO of start-ups\
      \ as well as large health systems and from each of these environments I have\
      \ learned a great deal that I believe is transferable to improving the VA,\u201D\
      \ he said. \u201CWhen seeking change, such as we are in VA, you are bound to\
      \ encounter challenges and make mistakes. Most important is to learn from these\
      \ experiences and not to repeat them -- that's how organizations get better\
      \ and improve performance.\u201D\n\nHe comes from a military family\n\nShulkin\
      \ may not be a veteran, but he does come from a military family.\n\nHe was born\
      \ on a military base in Illinois and his father was an Army physiatrist, according\
      \ to the Military Times. Both of his grandfathers served during World War I,\
      \ one of whom was also the chief pharmacist at the VA in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\
      \nHailing from a military family \"has sensitized me to the psychological and\
      \ medical needs of those who served our country,\u201D Shulkin said during his\
      \ 2015 confirmation hearing, according to the Military Times."

      \ Steve Bannon and now Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.\n\nSome,\
      \ such as Comey and Shulkin, were fired by President Trump, while others resigned\
      \ for a variety of reasons.\n\nTrump addressed the high turnover in the White\
      \ House in a March tweet, denying that there is any \"chaos.\"\n\n\"People will\
      \ always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision.\
      \ I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection),\"\
      \ he said.\n\nRead on for a look at some of the staffers who have left since\
      \ Trump took office.\n\nDavid Shulkin\n\nTrump announced in an early evening\
      \ tweet on March 28 that Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin will be\
      \ replaced by \"highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD.,\" who currently\
      \ serves as physician to the president.\n\n\"I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin\u2019\
      s service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nRobert\
      \ Wilkie, the under secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, will serve\
      \ as acting secretary until Jackson is confirmed, Trump said.\n\nH.R. McMaster\n\
      \nTrump announced March 22 that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster will\
      \ be replaced on April 9 by former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who is a Fox\
      \ News contributor.\n\n\"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R.\
      \ McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,\"\
      \ the president tweeted.\n\nMcMaster, 55, said in a statement, \"After thirty-four\
      \ years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army\
      \ effective this summer after which I will leave public service. Throughout\
      \ my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary\
      \ servicemembers and dedicated civilians.\"\n\nHe added that he is \"thankful\
      \ to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation\
      \ as national security advisor.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after months of\
      \ speculation over whether McMaster would resign or be fired from his post.\n\
      \nA White House official said March 22 that the president and McMaster \u201C\
      mutually agreed\u201D that he would resign from his post. The two have been\
      \ discussing this for some time, the official said, noting that the timeline\
      \ was expedited as they both felt it was important to have a new team in place,\
      \ instead of constant speculation.\n\nA White House official said the decision\
      \ was not related to any one moment or incident, but rather the result of ongoing\
      \ conversations between the two.\n\nAndrew McCabe\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions\
      \ fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on March 16 \u2013 just days before\
      \ he was set to retire, jeopardizing his pension.\n\nThe dismissal was made\
      \ on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials. A yet-to-be-released\
      \ inspector general report allegedly concluded McCabe had authorized the release\
      \ of information to the media and had not been forthcoming with the watchdog\
      \ office as it examined the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\
      \n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty,\
      \ integrity, and accountability,\" Sessions said in a statement after McCabe\
      \ was fired.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump said the firing marked a \u201Cgreat day for\
      \ the hard working men and women of the FBI.\u201D\n\nThe dismissal came after\
      \ McCabe, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, was \"removed\" from his position as\
      \ the No. 2 figure at the FBI and went on \"terminal leave\" in January, a source\
      \ told Fox News at the time.\n\nHe had repeatedly been criticized by Trump since\
      \ 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, had accepted campaign\
      \ contributions from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,\
      \ a close Clinton ally, during a failed state Senate run.\n\nRex Tillerson\n\
      \nTrump announced on March 13 that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be\
      \ replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nTillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief,\
      \ served as the nation\u2019s top diplomat since February 2017. Rumors of his\
      \ departure had circulated for months, especially after he reportedly called\
      \ Trump a \u201Cmoron\u201D in front of other Cabinet officials in July 2017.\n\
      \nIn a tweet, Trump thanked Tillerson for his service to the country. A senior\
      \ White House official told Fox News that Trump made the decision to replace\
      \ Tillerson ahead of a planned meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.\n\
      \nTillerson later told reporters that he is delegating his responsibilities\
      \ to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan until his final day at the end\
      \ of March.\n\nJohn McEntee\n\nTrump's longtime personal aide John McEntee,\
      \ 27, was escorted from the White House on March 13. McEntee, who was reportedly\
      \ well liked in the West Wing, occupied a key White House role, never far from\
      \ Trump in the White House or on the road.\n\nHe was moved to Trump's 2020 campaign,\
      \ where he will serve as a senior adviser for campaign operations, the Trump\
      \ campaign said.\n\nGary Cohn\n\nGary Cohn is set to leave his post as National\
      \ Economic Council director, Fox News confirmed March 6.\n\n\"Gary has been\
      \ my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping\
      \ to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy\
      \ once again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is a rare talent, and I thank\
      \ him for his dedicated service to the American people.\u201D\n\nCohn, who served\
      \ as Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser since the beginning of the administration,\
      \ had reportedly been discussing with the president his transition out of the\
      \ White House for several weeks. Cohn opposed Trump's planned tariffs on imports\
      \ of steel and aluminum and tried to get the president to change course.\n\n\
      White House officials told Fox News that Cohn's departure date is to be determined,\
      \ but it's expected to be in a few weeks.\n\nCohn drafted a resignation letter\
      \ last year, following the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville,\
      \ Va.\n\nRoberta Jacobson\n\nRoberta Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico,\
      \ said in a March 1 note that she would be resigning from her post in the spring.\n\
      \nHer resignation, which she said would take effect on May 5, comes amid strained\
      \ relations between the two countries. She did not specify why she will be leaving\
      \ her post but said on Twitter that she is \u201Cin search of other opportunities.\u201D\
      \n\n\"I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move\
      \ on to new challenges and adventures,\" Jacobson wrote in her note. \"This\
      \ decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance\
      \ of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.\"\
      \n\nA career diplomat, Jacobson previously served as assistant secretary of\
      \ state for Western Hemisphere affairs and is seen as having a deep understanding\
      \ of the region and the Mexico-U.S. relationship. She said she has spent more\
      \ than 31 years in government service.\n\nHope Hicks\n\nWhite House communications\
      \ director Hope Hicks is resigning, Fox News confirmed on Feb. 28.\n\nHicks,\
      \ 29, is one of Trump\u2019s longest serving aides, as she previously worked\
      \ for him and his family before he announced his candidacy.\n\n\u201CHope is\
      \ outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,\u201D Trump\
      \ said in a statement.\n\n\u201CThere are no words to adequately express my\
      \ gratitude to President Trump,\u201D Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren fashion model,\
      \ said in a statement. \u201CI wish the president and his administration the\
      \ very best as he continues to lead our country.\u201D\n\nThe announcement came\
      \ a day after Hicks acknowledged to a House intelligence panel that she occasionally\
      \ told \"white lies\" for Trump but denied lying about anything relevant to\
      \ the Russia investigation.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said\
      \ Hicks' decision to leave the administration was \u201Csomething that she\u2019\
      s been thinking about for a while.\u201D\n\nHicks, who largely worked behind\
      \ the scenes during her tenure with Trump, found herself in the spotlight earlier\
      \ this year when her relationship with former White House staff secretary Rob\
      \ Porter was revealed. Porter left his job earlier in February after allegations\
      \ surfaced that he physically abused his two ex-wives.\n\nJosh Raffel\n\nJosh\
      \ Raffel, a top White House communications aide who served as a spokesman for\
      \ Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, will leave the administration sometime in\
      \ the coming months.\n\nRaffel joined the administration in the spring of 2017.\
      \ He was hired to work on communications for the White House Office of American\
      \ Innovation and also worked on behalf of Kushner and Trump. His portfolio of\
      \ issues included tax reform and the Middle East peace process.\n\nIn a statement,\
      \ Ivanka Trump called Raffel \"honest, passionate and thoughtful,\" adding that\
      \ his \"guidance was invaluable.\"\n\nRaffel is expected to return to New York\
      \ to join the private sector and tend to family obligations, Axios reported.\n\
      \nDavid Sorensen\n\nWhite House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned on Feb.\
      \ 9 amid domestic abuse allegations.\n\nSorensen's ex-wife first told The Washington\
      \ Post that he was violent and emotionally abusive during their marriage. He\
      \ has denied the allegations.\n\nSorensen's position did not require a security\
      \ clearance, the White House said, adding that his background check was ongoing.\n\
      \n\n\nSorensen had worked as a senior adviser to Gov. Paul LePage, according\
      \ to the Portland Press Herald.\n\nRachel Brand\n\nRachel Brand is stepping\
      \ down from her position, Fox News confirmed on Feb. 9. Brand is an associate\
      \ attorney general in the Department of Justice.\n\nBrand, the No. 3 official\
      \ in the Justice Department, served in the role for nine months before accepting\
      \ a job with Walmart. She will serve as the retail giant's executive vice president,\
      \ global governance and corporate secretary.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News,\
      \ Brand disputed claims that she left the administration due to Special Counsel\
      \ Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\
      Rob Porter\n\nWhite House staff secretary Rob Porter announced his resignation\
      \ from the Trump administration on Feb. 7 following reports that he abused his\
      \ two ex-wives.\n\nPorter\u2019s ex-wives told the Daily Mail that he was physically\
      \ and mentally abusive.\n\nPorter denied the \u201Coutrageous allegations\"\
      \ and resigned from his position.\n\n\u201CI have been transparent and truthful\
      \ about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated\
      \ smear campaign,\u201D Porter said.\n\nTwo days after the resignation, Trump\
      \ wished the former staffer well, saying he hopes Porter has \"a great career\
      \ ahead of him.\" He said the allegations were \"very sad\" and stressed that\
      \ Porter has maintained his innocence.\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman\n\nA former\
      \ \u201CApprentice\u201D star, Omarosa Manigault Newman joined the Trump administration\
      \ as the director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison\
      \ to work on outreach to various contingency groups.\n\nWhite House press secretary\
      \ Sanders said on Dec. 13 that Manigault Newman\u2019s last day with the administration\
      \ would be on Jan. 20 \u2013 exactly one year since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\
      \nManigault Newman reportedly drew scrutiny from White House chief of staff\
      \ John Kelly. She also came under fire for bringing her 39-person bridal party\
      \ to the White House for a photo shoot in 2017.\n\nRichard Cordray\n\nRichard\
      \ Cordray resigned from his post as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection\
      \ Bureau on Nov. 24, 2017, setting off a fight between his former chief of staff\
      \ and the White House over who would replace him.\n\nCordray\u2019s resignation\
      \ didn\u2019t come as a surprise; he had previously said he would quit his job\
      \ by the end of November. But many thought his resignation would set up Trump\
      \ to appoint his own director of an agency that has been widely criticized by\
      \ his administration and Republicans alike.\n\nHowever, before his resignation,\
      \ Cordray elevated his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director\
      \ position \u2013 meaning she would become acting CFPB director after he quit.\
      \ But the White House announced Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management\
      \ and Budget, as its interim director.\n\nTom Price\n\nTom Price officially\
      \ resigned from his post as Health and Human Services Secretary on Sept. 29,\
      \ 2017, according to a White House statement.\n\nThe move came after Price received\
      \ major criticism following reports of his use of private planes.\n\nPrice had\
      \ promised to repay the government for the use of his costly flights and vowed\
      \ never to take a private charter plane again while in his post as secretary\
      \ but was ultimately let go anyway.\n\nSebastian Gorka\n\nThe White House announced\
      \ that Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to Trump, was no longer a part of the\
      \ administration during a Friday evening news dump on Aug. 25, 2017.\n\nWhite\
      \ House officials told Fox News that Gorka did not resign but confirmed that\
      \ he \u201Cno longer works\u201D with the administration.\n\nHowever, Gorka\
      \ insisted to the Washington Examiner that he did actually resign.\n\nA former\
      \ Breitbart news editor, Gorka joined the Trump administration as a counterterrorism\
      \ adviser and assisted with national security policy decisions alongside Bannon,\
      \ according to White House sources.\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nSteve Bannon was removed\
      \ from his position as White House chief strategist on Aug. 18, 2017.\n\nThe\
      \ Breitbart News chief joined Trump's presidential campaign and was later appointed\
      \ to a senior adviser role after Trump won the election.\n\nBannon, the hardcore\
      \ populist, had become increasingly isolated inside the White House following\
      \ John Kelly's appointment as chief of staff, White House sources and outside\
      \ advisers told Fox News.\n\nA White House aide told Fox News that Bannon\u2019\
      s ouster wasn\u2019t sudden; he submitted his resignation in writing several\
      \ weeks prior, the aide said.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nThe announcement of Anthony\
      \ Scaramucci as the White House communications director on July 21, 2017, set\
      \ into motion a big shakeup in White House staff.\n\nBut Scaramucci himself\
      \ lasted only 10 days in the White House. He was reportedly removed at the request\
      \ of new White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nKelly was sworn in as chief\
      \ of staff just hours before Scaramucci was removed.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nTrump\
      \ announced Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief\
      \ of staff on July 28, 2017, effectively ousting Reince Priebus.\n\nThe replacement\
      \ of Preibus as chief of staff came amid tensions between he and Scaramucci,\
      \ the White House communications director at the time.\n\nMichael Short\n\n\
      White House assistant press secretary Michael Short resigned on July 25, 2017,\
      \ after Scaramucci informed Politico of his intent to fire him.\n\n\u201CThis\
      \ is the problem with the leaking,\u201D Scaramucci reportedly told reporters.\
      \ \u201CThis is actually a terrible thing. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m firing Michael\
      \ Short today. The fact that you guys know about it before he does really upsets\
      \ me as a human being and as a Roman Catholic.\u201D\n\nSean Spicer\n\nAfter\
      \ the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci, White House press secretary Sean Spicer\
      \ announced his resignation on July 21, 2017.\n\nWalter Shaub\n\nOffice of Government\
      \ Ethics Director Walter Shaub Jr. announced on July 6, 2017 that he was resigning\
      \ from his job after clashing with Trump. His final date in office was July\
      \ 19.\n\nIn his position, Shaub was often at odds with the Trump administration,\
      \ particularly when it came to Trump\u2019s business dealings.\n\nShaub joined\
      \ the Campaign Legal Center, an organization in Washington that mostly focuses\
      \ on violations of campaign finance law.\n\nMichael Dubke\n\nWhile former White\
      \ House communications director Michael Dubke tendered his resignation quietly\
      \ on May 18, 2017, he stayed on with the administration until after the president\u2019\
      s first foreign trip.\n\nHe said that he resigned due to \u201Cpersonal\u201D\
      \ reasons.\n\nJames Comey\n\nTrump abruptly fired former FBI Director James\
      \ Comey in a brief letter on May 9, 2017, saying Comey could not \u201Ceffectively\
      \ lead\u201D the bureau any longer.\n\nTrump repeatedly criticized Comey\u2019\
      s handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019\
      s personal email server, and Comey said after his firing that he felt uncomfortable\
      \ by comments Trump made about the FBI\u2019s investigation into Michael Flynn.\n\
      \nComey reportedly was speaking to employees in Los Angeles when news of his\
      \ ousting came across the television. At the time, according to reports, Comey\
      \ thought it was a prank.\n\nKatie Walsh\n\nDeputy chief of staff Katie Walsh\
      \ resigned on March 30, 2017, after a Trump-backed health care bill failed to\
      \ make it through the House, according to The Associated Press.\n\nShe left\
      \ the White House to join the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policies.\n\n\
      Walsh came to the White House after serving in the Republican National Committee\
      \ under then-chairman Reince Priebus.\n\nPreet Bharara\n\nManhattan federal\
      \ prosecutor Preet Bharara was fired on March 11, 2017, after he declined to\
      \ willingly resign from his job.\n\nThe Justice Department said attorneys general\
      \ who were holdovers from the Obama administration needed to resign. Bharara\
      \ refused to do so.\n\n\u201CI did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,\u201D\
      \ Bharara tweeted. \u201CBeing the US Attorney in [the Southern District of\
      \ New York] will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.\u201D\
      \n\nMichael Flynn\n\nMichael Flynn, Trump\u2019s embattled national security\
      \ adviser, resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, after it was revealed that he apparently\
      \ lied about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador.\n\n\u201CI have\
      \ nothing to be ashamed for and everything to be proud of,\u201D Flynn told\
      \ Fox News at the time.\n\nSally Yates\n\nTaking over as acting attorney general\
      \ following the departure of Loretta Lynch, Sally Yates was removed from her\
      \ position on January 30, 2017.\n\nYates refused to enforce Trump\u2019s controversial\
      \ travel ban and issued a memo to the Justice Department not to defend the executive\
      \ order.\n\nFox News' Kristin Brown, Jake Gibson, Serafin Gomez, Alex Pappas,\

      \nOn the roster: Welcome to the jungle, Amazon - I\u2019ll Tell You What: Constituting\
      \ a real debate - Arizona special election heating up - Pence clobbers Heitkamp\
      \ on her home turf - \u2018That\u2019s how Ruff Ryders roll\u2019\n\nWELCOME\
      \ TO THE JUNGLE, AMAZON\n\nIt was like old times today when Amazon shares tumbled\
      \ on word from the favored source of White House leaks, Axios, that President\
      \ Trump had it in for America\u2019s online retail behemoth.\n\n\n\nIt has been\
      \ a year since the president could rip some corporation and watch stock prices\
      \ tumble. As 2017 wore on and American\u2019s remembered the virtues of limited\
      \ government and the separation of powers, investors started to worry less about\
      \ the president\u2019s pronouncements and focused more on actual policies.\n\
      \n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just because investors are quite skittish these days,\
      \ or maybe it\u2019s because the president has started to govern less like a\
      \ traditional Republican and more like the populist he promised in 2016. But\
      \ Jeff Bezos\u2019 baby lost more than 4 percent of its value on Wall Street\
      \ today.\n\n\n\nAnother factor here may be the growing sense that the government\
      \ is coming for the lightly regulated tech giants after two decades of kid-glove\
      \ treatment. Facebook\u2019s crash in credibility is going to have some unhappy\
      \ consequences for the rest of the tech sector, and maybe Amazon will get gigged\
      \ in the process.\n\n\n\nAccording to New York Magazine, Trump\u2019s antipathy\
      \ towards Amazon has less to do with a desire to prop up failing retailers and\
      \ more to do with his vendetta against Bezos\u2019 Washington Post and its bruising\
      \ coverage of Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nWhatever is driving the train when\
      \ it comes to Amazon, it\u2019s pretty clearly a real thing.\n\n\n\nWe have\
      \ known for a while that this administration, unlike most Republicans, is in\
      \ favor of a federally imposed sales tax on internet purchases. And when asked\
      \ about the reports, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders gave a classic\
      \ non-denial denial in which she said there was nothing to report\u2026 today.\n\
      \n\n\nSanders went on to say that the president believes it\u2019s the job of\
      \ the federal government to \u201Ccreate a level playing field for all businesses.\u201D\
      \n\n\n\nChew on that one for a minute. Retailers operate in a cutthroat world\
      \ of low profit margins, high volume and no mercy for the weak. There\u2019\
      s little that\u2019s level about that sector of our economy.\n\n\n\nEvery freshman\
      \ economics student has heard the story about the battle between the big retailers\
      \ Sears and Montgomery Ward at the end of World War II. Montgomery Ward, believing\
      \ that a post-war recession would be inevitable and lasting, focused on catalogue\
      \ sales, smaller payrolls and lower real estate costs. Sears did just the opposite\
      \ and went on a building and buying spree that changed the retail landscape\
      \ of the country.\n\n\n\nSears was right and Montgomery Ward was wrong. But\
      \ then, cheap-o department stores sprang up and ruined Sears\u2019 model. They\
      \ sold more for less thanks to cheap Chinese imports and skeletal staffing.\
      \ Now, it\u2019s Walmart\u2019s turn to cry as Amazon has found ways to undercut\
      \ what was previously considered rock bottom.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an open question\
      \ whether federal government could save Sears, Walmart and others by going after\
      \ Amazon. If the feds impose the right combination of antitrust actions and\
      \ tax increases, Trump could conceivably harm his foe. But it\u2019s hard to\
      \ think that someone else wouldn\u2019t come along and take advantage of the\
      \ same business model to finally kill off America\u2019s once-flourishing shopping\
      \ mall sector.\n\n\n\nThis may just be courtiers at Axios venting Trump\u2019\

      \ owners knew this was the end game for all \u2018common sense\u2019 gun laws.\
      \ The reality I see is that the heartland will likely not play along and thus\
      \ practically I don\u2019t see the 2nd getting repealed ever. As a long time\
      \ gun owner, and target shooter, I think getting necessary votes are practically\
      \ impossible. \u2026 What bothers me is the fact that mass shootings in a \u2018\
      gun free zone\u2019 is a somewhat modern problem and we don\u2019t seem to be\
      \ addressing the core issue. It\u2019s not the gun that shot all those folks\
      \ in the various incidents. It was a person and we need to solve what is wrong\
      \ with our society that we don\u2019t value life and respect each other over\
      \ killing innocents. Keep up the great work. Your reports are always fascinating\
      \ and educational.\u201D \u2013 Peter Eick, Houston\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: We did\
      \ get a lot of responses, most of them quite thoughtful, just as yours is. If\
      \ we take a step back and look at the longer game here, we see how Americans\
      \ in favor of gun control, as well as other liberal causes, successfully use\
      \ the courts to advance their agendas starting with Civil Rights. Stevens himself\
      \ speaks wistfully of the court of his fellow Republican appointee, former Chief\
      \ Justice Warren Burger. The Burger court resided over momentous changes in\
      \ American law, life and culture. Probably the most significant of these was\
      \ preventing states from barring women access to elected abortions, but there\
      \ were many other decisions that helped advance liberal causes. Conservatives\
      \ got wise and made the courts a particular focus of their own, as is well reflected\
      \ in the courts of the last two Chief Justices, William Rehnquist and John Roberts.\
      \ Now that the definitional terms have changed, liberals are confronted with\
      \ the fact that the Constitution is not a \u201Cliving document\u201D in the\
      \ way they previously saw it. That term rightly refers to the fact the Constitution\
      \ can be amended, but for much of the past half century it has been taken to\
      \ mean that our interpretation of the document is situational depending on the\
      \ wants and needs of the people at any given moment. The victory of the originalists\
      \ may ultimately be a victory for the original design of the document. This\
      \ is really the second longest stretch between the ratification of constitutional\
      \ amendments in U.S. history. There was one ratified in 1992, but that\u2019\
      s kind of a technicality. The 27th Amendment was part of the original Bill of\
      \ Rights and had passed all but a couple of the necessary states before being\
      \ set aside. It took the work of a handful of activists and a few state legislatures\
      \ to push it across the finish line. The last regular amendment was passed in\
      \ 1971, setting the voting age at 18. Prior to that new amendments came with\
      \ considerable regularity, especially in the period after the Civil War. It\u2019\
      s about time we get back to using the Constitution the way it was intended.\
      \ And if strict constructionalism at the Supreme Court has pushed liberals to\
      \ embrace that concept then I say, good for them.]\n\n\n\n\u201CHi Chris, Thanks\

      \ of the original or clarifies the tension between \u201Cwell regulated\u201D\

    text: 'A federal judge Wednesday allowed Maryland and the District of Columbia
      to proceed with their lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump of accepting unconstitutional
      gifts from foreign interests, but limited the case to the president''s involvement
      with the Trump International Hotel in Washington.




      U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte''s ruling dismissed other sections of
      the lawsuit that raised concerns about the impact of foreign gifts to the president
      from Trump Organization properties outside of Washington.




      Maryland and D.C. accuse the president of violating the emoluments clause of
      the Constitution, which bans the president and other federal officials from
      accepting gifts from foreign governments as well as U.S. states. Specifically,
      they allege nearby businesses have been subjected to increased competition as
      a result of the foreign traffic to the Trump Hotel.




      "Their allegation is bolstered by explicit statements from certain foreign government
      officials indicating that they are clearly choosing to stay at the president''s
      hotel because, as one representative of a foreign government has stated, they
      want him to know `I love your new hotel,"'' Messitte wrote in his 47-page ruling.




      But the judge also warned the plaintiffs that their "claims sweep too broadly,"
      saying "it is a considerable stretch, however, to find the requisite injury-in-fact"
      to Maryland and D.C. from Trump properties outside of Washington.




      Despite Messitte''s limited ruling, a watchdog group that has joined the two
      jurisdictions in the lawsuit was quick to hail the judge''s decision.




      "This is a major step forward for the emoluments litigation," said Norman Eisen,
      a former chief ethics lawyer for the Obama administration and chairman of Citizens
      for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also called CREW. Eisen said the
      decision suggests that states and businesses near Trump enterprises in other
      parts of the country may also have legal standing to sue.




      Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said "we won the first round. It''s a
      very clear decision that Donald Trump is not above the law and has to be held
      accountable to the emoluments clause."




      D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, tweeted: "We have standing to hold Pres.
      Trump accountable for violating the Constitution."




      It was not immediately clear whether the Trump administration would appeal the
      ruling.




      White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to address the issue
      during an afternoon press briefing, saying "I can''t comment on pending litigation."




      Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said "we believe this case should
      be dismissed, and we will continue to defend the president in court."




      Although the Trump Organization was not a party in the litigation, the company
      said it was pleased that the judge did not allow the lawsuit to target other
      Trump properties.




      "The court''s decision today does significantly narrow the scope of the case,"
      said a company spokeswoman. The court has yet to rule on several additional
      arguments, which we believe should result in a complete dismissal."




      If the judge''s ruling holds, it could allow Maryland and DC to press for documents
      showing how foreign government interests or U.S. states used the Trump hotel
      and how much money they spent there.




      Late last year, a judge in New York threw out a similar lawsuit filed by CREW,
      ruling that the emoluments clause is an issue that Congress should address first.
      A third federal lawsuit has been filed against Trump on the issue by nearly
      200 Democratic members of Congress.

    text: "Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced Wednesday\
      \ he will review potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses\
      \ by both the Justice Department and the FBI, following requests from Congress\
      \ and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General\
      \ released a statement Wednesday outlining the start of the review.\n\n\u201C\
      The OIG will initiate a review that will examine the Justice Department\u2019\
      s and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s compliance with legal requirements,\
      \ and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed\
      \ with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a\
      \ certain U.S. person,\u201D the statement obtained by Fox News read. \u201C\
      As part of this examination, the OIG also will review information that was known\
      \ to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about\
      \ an alleged FBI confidential source.\u201D\n\nThe OIG statement added that\
      \ Horowitz also would \u201Creview the DOJ\u2019s and FBI\u2019s relationship\
      \ and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.\u201D\
      \n\nThe statement continued, \u201CIf circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider\
      \ including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.\u201D\
      \n\nLast month, Sessions directed Horowitz to probe the allegations of government\
      \ surveillance abuse, in light of memos released on Capitol Hill by the House\
      \ Intelligence Committee about FBI and DOJ efforts to obtain FISA warrants to\
      \ surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\n\u201CWe believe the Department\
      \ of Justice must adhere to the high standards in the FISA court,\u201D Sessions\
      \ said in February at a news conference. \u201CYes it will be investigated.\
      \ And I think that\u2019s just the appropriate thing the inspector general will\
      \ take that as one of the matters he\u2019ll deal with.\u201D\n\nHouse Intel\
      \ Republicans released a memo in late February detailing the DOJ's and FBI\u2019\
      s surveillance of Page, saying the infamous anti-Trump dossier funded by Democrats\
      \ \u201Cformed an essential part\u201D of the application to spy on him.\n\n\
      The dossier, authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned\
      \ by Fusion GPS, was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and\
      \ Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign through the law firm Perkins\
      \ Coie. It included salacious and unverified allegations about President Trump\u2019\
      s connections to Russia.\n\nThe Republican memo stated that former FBI Deputy\
      \ Director Andrew McCabe testified that \u201Cno surveillance warrant would\
      \ have been sought\u201D from the FISA court \u201Cwithout the Steele dossier\
      \ information.\u201D\n\nThe memo also said Steele, who worked as an FBI informant,\
      \ eventually was cut off from the bureau for what the FBI described as the most\
      \ serious of violations, \u201Can unauthorized disclosure to the media of his\
      \ relationship with the FBI.\u201D\n\nThe memo noted that the FBI and DOJ obtained\
      \ \u201Cone initial FISA warrant\u201D targeting Page and three FISA renewals\
      \ from the FISC. The statute required that every 90 days, a FISA order on an\
      \ American citizen \u201Cmust be reviewed.\u201D\n\nFormer FBI Director James\
      \ Comey signed three FISA applications for Page, while McCabe, current Deputy\
      \ Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who leads the Russia probe, former Deputy\
      \ Attorney General Sally Yates and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana\
      \ Boente signed at least one, according the Republican memo.\n\nDemocrats, then,\
      \ released a rebuttal memo.\n\nThe White House said the GOP memo raised \u201C\
      serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels\
      \ of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the government\u2019s most\
      \ intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.\u201D\n\nRepublican\
      \ lawmakers and Sessions had been pressing Horowitz to probe the alleged FISA\
      \ abuses.\n\nJust this week, FBI Director Wray announced plans to \u201Cdouble\
      \ the number\u201D of agents handing records for the House Judiciary Committee\
      \ after it subpoenaed the Justice Department for documents on FISA, the Clinton\
      \ email investigation and the firing of McCabe.\n\nOver the last year, Horowitz\
      \ has been conducting a review of the FBI's and DOJ\u2019s actions related to\
      \ the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while\
      \ she was secretary of state. A final report on the investigation is expected\

    text: "Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed Thursday a federal prosecutor was\
      \ evaluating certain issues involving the FBI, the Clinton Foundation and Uranium\
      \ One, but said he would not appoint a second special counsel at this point.\n\
      \nIn a letter directed to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, House Judiciary\
      \ Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey\
      \ Gowdy, Sessions revealed that he asked U.S. Attorney John Huber to lead the\
      \ evaluation into issues raised by the committees in recent months.\n\n\u201C\
      I write in response to recent letters requesting the appointment of a Special\
      \ Counsel to review certain prosecutorial and investigative determinations made\
      \ by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017. I take the concerns you raise\
      \ seriously,\u201D Sessions wrote, noting how important it was that the American\
      \ people and Congress had \u201Cconfidence\u201D in the Justice Department.\n\
      \nSessions referenced a November 2017 letter sent by Assistant Attorney General\
      \ Stephen Boyd, first reported by Fox News, directing senior federal prosecutors\
      \ to evaluate \u201Ccertain issues\u201D requested by congressional Republicans,\
      \ involving the sale of Uranium One and alleged unlawful dealings related to\
      \ the Clinton Foundation.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 2017, Boyd wrote: \u201CThese senior\
      \ prosecutors will report directly to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney\
      \ General [Rod Rosenstein], as appropriate, and will make recommendations as\
      \ to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened,\
      \ whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources,\
      \ or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel.\u201D\n\
      \nSessions revealed Thursday in the letter to top Republican lawmakers in both\
      \ chambers of Congress that Huber was the senior federal prosecutor leading\
      \ that effort.\n\n\u201CMr. Huber is conducting his work from outside the Washington\
      \ D.C. area and in cooperation with the Inspector General,\u201D Sessions said,\
      \ noting that Huber\u2019s review would \u201Cinclude a full, complete, and\
      \ objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that is consistent with\
      \ the law and facts.\u201D\n\nHuber is a federal prosecutor, twice confirmed,\
      \ unanimously, by the Senate as U.S. attorney for the District of Utah in 2015\
      \ and again in 2017. Huber previously served in leadership roles within the\
      \ U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office as national security section chief and executive\
      \ assistant U.S. attorney.\n\n\u201CI receive regular updates from Mr. Huber\
      \ and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his recommendations as\
      \ to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened,\
      \ whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources,\
      \ or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,\u201D Sessions\
      \ said.\n\nHuber ultimately would be the prosecutor to decide whether issues\
      \ raised by Republicans in Congress warrant the appointment of a second special\
      \ counsel, Sessions said.\n\nThe attorney general cited U.S. Code, noting that\
      \ the appointment of a special counsel was \"reserved for use in only the most\
      \ 'extraordinary circumstances,'\" and that any special counsel must be \"selected\
      \ from outside the United States Government.\"\n\n\"To justify such an appointment,\
      \ the Attorney General would need to conclude that 'the public interest would\
      \ be served by removing a large degree of responsibility for the matter from\
      \ the Department of Justice,\" the letter read.\n\nSessions added, \"The Department\
      \ has successfully investigated and prosecuted many high-profile resource-intensive\
      \ matters since the regulations were promulgated in 1999, but the regulations'\
      \ standard has been found to be satisfied on only two occasions,\" and said\
      \ it was \"more common\" to appoint \"accountable prosecutors\" to conduct investigations\
      \ within the department.\n\nOn March 6, Gowdy, R-S.C., and Goodlatte, R-Va.,\
      \ penned a joint letter to Sessions demanding the appointment of a special counsel\
      \ to investigate \"conflicts of interest\" and decisions \"made and not made\"\
      \ by current and former Justice Department officials in 2016 and 2017, noting\
      \ that \"the public interest requires\" the action.\n\nThe letter cited potential\
      \ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses, which Justice Department\
      \ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced Wednesday would be investigated\
      \ by his team.\n\n\u201CThe Office of Inspector General will initiate a review\
      \ that will examine the Justice Department\u2019s and the Federal Bureau of\
      \ Investigation\u2019s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable\
      \ DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign\
      \ Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person,\u201D\
      \ the Horowitz statement obtained by Fox News read. \u201CAs part of this examination,\
      \ the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI\
      \ at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential\
      \ source.\u201D\n\nSessions told lawmakers in his Thursday letter that he understood\
      \ the Justice Department was \"not above criticism,\" and noted that if anyone\
      \ \"falls short\" of the \"highest level of integrity, ethics and professionalism,\"\
      \ he would act.\n\n\"I will fulfill my responsibility to take necessary action\
      \ to protect the integrity of our work,\" Sessions wrote, thanking the lawmakers\
      \ for their \"leadership\" on the matters, and stating that he would make their\
      \ letters available to both Huber and Horowitz.\n\nFox News' Bill Mears contributed\

    text: 'Former CIA Director John Brennan once again took a shot at President Trump
      on Twitter Thursday, saying he believes the decision to nominate Adm. Ronny
      Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs is "terribly misguided."


      "I personally know and greatly respect Ronny Jackson....as a terrific doctor
      and Navy officer," Brennan tweeted. "However, he has neither the experience
      nor the credentials to run the very large and complex VA. This is a terribly
      misguided nomination that will hurt both a good man and our veterans."


      Trump announced via Twitter Wednesday his intention to replace current VA Secretary
      David Shulkin with Jackson, a 50-year-old Navy rear admiral who has served as
      personal physician to the president since 2013, when he was appointed by former
      President Obama, after being tapped to serve as a White House doctor in 2006.


      RONNY JACKSON PICKED BY TRUMP TO LEAD THE VA: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENT''S
      PHYSICIAN


      Jackson''s also a veteran. He was deployed to Iraq after he joined the 2nd Marines
      in 2005, according to his Navy biography.


      Jackson''s nomination triggered some concern among lawmakers and veterans groups
      about his experience to manage a federal agency, but Trump praised the lifelong
      doctor as "highly trained and qualified."


      Trump decided to oust Shulkin from his Cabinet after he served just over a year
      in office. An internal VA watchdog found last month that Shulkin improperly
      accepted Wimbledon tennis tickets and that his then-chief of staff had doctored
      emails to justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at taxpayer''s expense.


      The swipe from Brennan, now an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, isn''t the first
      he''s made against Trump.


      Just last week, he suggested that the Russians "may have something" against
      the president, and days prior to that in response to former FBI official Andrew
      McCabe''s firing: "When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and
      political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced
      demagogue in the dustbin of history."

    text: "President Trump touted the early stages of construction of the wall along\
      \ the U.S.-Mexico border, promising to \u201Cget that sucker built\u201D in\
      \ a campaign-style speech Thursday in Richfield, Ohio.\n\nThe speech, which\
      \ lasted over an hour, was slated to help roll out his $1.5 trillion infrastructure\
      \ plan, but he also hit a wide range of agenda items, including his paramount\
      \ campaign promise: the border wall.\n\n\u201CWe started our wall\u2014what\
      \ a thing of beauty,\u201D Trump said, noting critics suggested he would \u201C\
      give up.\u201D \u201CHas he given up? No I never give up.\u201D\n\nTrump added:\
      \ \u201CWe\u2019re getting that sucker built!\u201D\n\nThe president\u2019s\
      \ camments come after he floated the idea of reprogramming military-designated\
      \ funding to finance construction of the wall. Congressional sources told Fox\
      \ News this week the move would be \u201Cimpossible\u201D without congressional\
      \ approval at some point in the \u201Creprogramming process,\u201D as the money\
      \ would need to be moved from one agency to another.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion omnibus\
      \ spending package that was passed last week designated only $1.6 billion toward\
      \ construction of the wall. The president repeatedly has called the $1.6 billion\
      \ a \u201Cdown payment\u201D for the wall.\n\n\u201CThe wall looks good. It\u2019\
      s properly designed. That what I do. I build,\u201D Trump said. \u201CI was\
      \ always very good at building, I think better than being president. I was very\
      \ good at building. But I think I\u2019ll be better as president... that will\
      \ be good.\u201D\n\nTrump discussed the different prototypes reviewed for construction\
      \ of the wall, and said that \u201Cwe have something special happening\u201D\
      \ in the early stages of building.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president tweeted photos\
      \ of the \u201Cstart of our Southern Border WALL!\u201D which were taken earlier\
      \ in California. The Department of Homeland Security said the photos were of\
      \ an area of border wall replacement, which would be an approximately 2.25-mile\
      \ section replaced with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall.\n\nTrump went on\
      \ to compare the United States border to the Koreas \u2013 noting that the U.S.\
      \ has spent \u201Cbillions of dollars\u201D to maintain other countries\u2019\
      \ borders.\n\n\u201CLook at Korea. We have a border at Korea. We have a wall\
      \ of soldiers who don\u2019t get paid very much for this. You look at that,\
      \ and nobody comes through,\u201D Trump said Thursday. \u201CBut our own border\u2014\
      we don\u2019t take care of it.\u201D\n\nHe added: \u201CWe spend billions of\
      \ dollars in other countries maintaining their borders, but we can\u2019t maintain\
      \ the border of our own country.\u201D\n\nThe president later shifted to the\
      \ trade deal approved between the United States and South Korea earlier this\
      \ week, noting that he may delay the agreement until a deal is struck with North\
      \ Korea, suggesting that would be \u201Ca very strong card.\u201D\n\nThe Trump\
      \ administration re-negotiated the six-year-old U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement\
      \ (KORUS), to address the massive trade deficit and increase U.S. car sales\
      \ in Seoul. The deal reached also would exempt South Korea from the Trump administration\u2019\
      s new 25-percent steel tariff, but not from the new 10-percent tariff on aluminum\
      \ imports.\n\n\u201CI may hold it up \u2014 do you know why? Because it\u2019\
      s a very strong card. And I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly,\u201D\
      \ Trump said. \u201CWe\u2019re moving along very nicely with North Korea. We\u2019\
      ll see what happens. Certainly the rhetoric has calmed down a little.\u201D\n\
      \nTrump referenced the upcoming unscheduled meeting with the rogue regime\u2019\
      s dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201CIf it\u2019s no good, we\u2019re walking. And\
      \ if it is good, we\u2019ll embrace it,\u201D Trump said. \u201CIt\u2019s going\
      \ to be very interesting. We\u2019ll hold the South Korea deal up for a little\
      \ while \u2014 see how it all plays out.\u201D\n\nSpeaking to the crowd south\
      \ of Cleveland, the president also hit on other key issues \u2013 including\
      \ the economy, the \u201C3 million new jobs since election day,\u201D and vocational\
      \ schools. Trump said he would direct Congress to approve student financial\
      \ aid for those schools, to create classes of successful workers in skilled\
      \ trades and construction.\n\nThe infrastructure plan, which the president tweeted\
      \ about minutes after he finished his speech, also would include a $50 billion\
      \ \u201Ccommitment\u201D to building in rural communities, which he said were\
      \ \u201Ctoo often left behind.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe will transform our roads and\
      \ bridges from a source of endless frustration into a source of incredible pride,\u201D\
      \ Trump said, noting that 40 percent of bridges in the U.S. were \u201Cbuilt\
      \ before the first moon landing.\u201D\n\nThe $1.5 trillion plan is slated to\
      \ \u201Cinvest\u201D in the American worker, \u201Ctransform\u201D the permit\
      \ program by further slashing regulations, and invest in the rural communities\
      \ \u2014 all through a partnership between federal, state and local governments,\
      \ and aid from the private sector, officials have said.\n\nThe president also\
      \ said Thursday that Congress directed $2 billion to improve veterans\u2019\
      \ medical facilities, as part of the omnibus spending package. Trump discussed\
      \ accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, just one day after he\
      \ fired VA Secretary David Shulkin and named Dr. Ronny Jackson to replace him.\
      \ The president, though, did not mention Shulkin in his remarks Thursday.\n\n\
      Trump also went on to discuss the fight against the Islamic State terror network.\n\
      \n\u201CBy the way, we\u2019re knocking the hell out of ISIS,\u201D Trump said.\
      \ \u201CWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria like, very soon. Let the other people\
      \ take care of it.\u201D"

      \ to meet certain work requirements to benefit from the state\u2019s Supplemental\
      \ Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nGov. Jim Justice signed the bill Tuesday,\
      \ according to the Charleston-Gazette Mail, which noted there was no news conference\
      \ or public statement after the bill was signed.\n\nA spokesperson for Gov.\
      \ Justice did not immediately return Fox News\u2019 request for comment Thursday.\n\
      \nThe bill applies to any \u201Cable-bodied\u201D adults ages 18 to 49 who aren't\
      \ pregnant, have no dependents and are not disabled or military veterans. To\
      \ receive SNAP benefits, those recipients will have to either work, volunteer\
      \ or participate in workforce training for at least 20 hours a week.\n\nThe\
      \ bill would allow recipients in certain counties to receive a work requirement\
      \ waiver until October 2022. After that point, \u201Cno able-bodied working\
      \ adults in the state can receive waivers from the work requirement,\u201D the\

      \ 26-year high - Trump heads to Ohio to revive infrastructure plan - The Judge\u2019\
      s Ruling: Free from death, free in life - Not so wise, Mr. Owl\n\nCAN REPUBLICANS\
      \ WIN WITHOUT HILLARY?\n\nDid Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election,\
      \ or did Hillary Clinton lose it? On that question rides a great deal, not the\
      \ least of which are the Republican Party\u2019s chances to hold the House of\
      \ Representatives.\n\nAs with most things in politics and life, the answer is:\
      \ a little bit of both. Trump did far better than expected, connecting with\
      \ voters in a way that the political intelligentia could not imagine.\n\nOne\
      \ of the reasons that MAGA nation is so excited about the big ratings for the\
      \ revival of the sitcom \u201CRoseanne\u201D is that it is taken as further\
      \ evidence of the way in which traditionally Democratic, blue collar voters\
      \ adore Trump. And they are not wrong.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to underestimate\
      \ just how awful a candidate Clinton really was. She has provided ample reminders\
      \ of her terribleness in the past year. She has intended in a book and in public\
      \ appearances to re-write the record of her second presidential defeat, but\
      \ only managed to remind even those who voted for her that she is astonishingly\
      \ maladroit.\n\nThe two least liked, least trusted major party nominees in modern\
      \ history just happened to be running in the same year and, as it turned out,\
      \ Clinton was viewed with even greater disdain than her opponent, who benefitted\
      \ from the absence of a record to have to defend. The devil they knew was actually\
      \ not preferable to the one they didn\u2019t.\n\nThe reason the proportion of\
      \ causation for Trump\u2019s 2016 victory is so important is that if we knew\
      \ whether he won or she lost we would know what lasting lessons that election\
      \ might teach us.\n\nRepublicans are hoping that the answer is more that Trump\
      \ won since that would mean that they could run to hold Congress as promising\
      \ to deliver on his campaign promises.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, hope that it\
      \ was Clinton\u2019s fault and that with her at least mostly out of the picture\
      \ the political climate can return to something more like what it was before.\n\
      \nAnd so we turn to our favorite political laboratory of late, Pennsylvania.\n\
      \nA Keystone State survey just out from Franklin and Marshall College reinforces\
      \ the message of a recent special election in the Pittsburg area. The poll shows\
      \ that incumbent Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob\
      \ Casey Jr. are absolutely demolishing their likely Republican challengers in\
      \ the fall.\n\nNow, a word of caution here. The Republican challengers are far\
      \ less well known than the incumbents, a fact which will be changed in the coming\
      \ months as money and advertisements begin to flow.\n\nBut at the outset, Republicans\
      \ find themselves at the bottom of a hole as deep and as dark as any anthracite\
      \ mine.\n\nThe fact that Conor Lamb won the special election in Pittsburgh amplifies\
      \ the findings of this poll. The preferred narrative of Democrats is that Trump\
      \ is so unpopular in places like Pennsylvania now that he is dragging Republicans\
      \ down. But we would suggest it\u2019s something different.\n\nWith the absence\
      \ of the devil they know, Pennsylvania voters are free to do as they wish, and\
      \ what they have mostly wished in the past 20 years is to be governed by Democrats.\n\
      \nTake a look at the 2016 exit polls from Pennsylvania. If we only showed you\
      \ Trump\u2019s low favorability rating and low trustworthiness rating with Pennsylvania\
      \ voters, you would have assumed he got creamed in the state. But flit your\
      \ eyes up to the Clinton line and you see how he won his narrow upset.\n\nThis\
      \ helps us understand why, even as we observe Trump\u2019s overall job approval\
      \ rating to be returning from a recent tumble, we don\u2019t see Republicans\
      \ fairing that much better in their efforts to hold Congress and governor\u2019\
      s mansions across the country.\n\nThis is of course not to say that Trump and\
      \ the success of his presidency is not an important, maybe even dominant consideration\
      \ in how 2018 will shake out. But it would do well for both parties to bear\
      \ in mind that the greatest disruption we saw in 2016 might not have been Trump\
      \ but Democrats\u2019 selection of their worse nominee in modern American political\
      \ history.\n\nLikely Missouri Republican Senate nominee Josh Hawley seems to\
      \ understand this as he zeroes in on Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s longtime support\
      \ for Clinton.\n\nIf what we are seeing in Pennsylvania is indicative, count\
      \ on Republicans doing their best to make Clinton as much a part of 2018 as\
      \ they can.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: WON\u2019T GET FOOLED AGAIN\n\n\u201CThe patriots,\
      \ who effected that memorable [Glorious Revolution of 1688], were too temperate,\
      \ too wellinformed, to think of any restraint on the legislative discretion.\u201D\

      \n\n\nHOUSE VACANCIES HIT 26-YEAR HIGH\n\nSabato\u2019s Crystal Ball: \u201C\
      In the roughly two and a half months since we last assessed an already-long\
      \ list of House open seats this cycle \u2014 and even in the week since my colleague\
      \ Geoffrey Skelley took a deep look at the pace of House retirements historically\
      \ \u2014 the number of open House seats has continued to increase. At this point,\
      \ only 379 of 435 House districts currently have an incumbent running for reelection.\
      \ That is now the second-lowest total of the post-World War II era, trailing\
      \ only 1992, when redistricting and other factors prompted a slew of retirements\
      \ and only 368 of 435 seats featured incumbents running for reelection. This\
      \ cycle will not match 1992\u2019s historically high level of open seats, but\
      \ the total likely will grow at least a little. Filing deadlines have passed\
      \ in many states, but filing remains open or has not yet opened in states containing\
      \ about 40% of the total number of House seats. And candidates can also leave\
      \ the ballot after filing has closed.\u201D\n\nScalise goes on the record with\
      \ interest in replacing Ryan - Politico: \u201C[Steve Scalise\u2019s] recovery\
      \ has coincided with his fast-rising stature within the House Republican Conference.\
      \ \u2026 Now the 52-year-old is being talked up as a possible successor to Ryan\
      \ when the House speaker retires. And the talk bubbled to the surface this week\
      \ when two GOP lawmakers \u2014 Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Mo Brooks of\
      \ Alabama \u2014 vocalized what others have whispered privately for weeks. \u2026\
      \ \u2018I wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u2019 Scalise said of a bid for speaker\
      \ if the circumstances were right. \u2018Obviously, I\u2019ve shown interest\
      \ in the past at moving up. I\u2019ve enjoyed being in leadership. I feel like\
      \ I\u2019ve had a strong influence on some of the things that we\u2019ve done,\
      \ and I\u2019ve helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of Obamacare.\u2019\
      \ \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s easy to get drawn into the palace intrigue and speculation.\

      The Democratic candidate seeking to unseat House Intelligence Committee chairman\
      \ Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has raised over $1 million in campaign funds in the\
      \ first quarter of the year, according to CNN. Fresno County Deputy District\
      \ Attorney Andrew Janz said the large influx of campaign funds came as Nunes\
      \ failed to address the issues affecting his constituents. The Republican has\
      \ been at the center of a political firestorm in recent months as he led his\
      \ committee's efforts to probe alleged surveillance abuse at the Justice Department\
      \ and the FBI. \u2018Devin Nunes is in Washington playing games on the House\
      \ Intelligence Committee,\u2019 Janz told CNN. \u2018And while he is doing that\
      \ the issues back here at home that people care about are being ignored.\u2019\
      \u201D\n\nCochran replacement will try to warm up chilly White House - WaPo:\
      \ \u201CWhite House officials planned to meet Wednesday with Republican Cindy\
      \ Hyde-Smith, who received a frosty reception in the West Wing when she was\
      \ appointed to the Senate last week. Hyde-Smith was slated to sit down with\
      \ administration officials including White House political director Bill Stepien,\
      \ according to three people familiar with the talks. But she was not expected\
      \ to meet with President Trump. The people describing the talks spoke on the\
      \ condition of anonymity because the talks had not been announced publicly.\
      \ It was unclear whether the gathering would forge a thaw in the troubled relationship\
      \ or move the president any closer to endorsing Hyde-Smith, as her supporters\
      \ would like to see. The uncertain dynamic has complicated the outlook for Republicans\
      \ in the midterm election, as they seek to defend their 51-49 Senate majority.\u201D\
      \n\nTRUMP HEADS TO OHIO TO REVIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN\n\nRoll Call: \u201CPresident\
      \ Donald Trump will take Air Force One to Ohio \u2014 then likely on to his\
      \ South Florida resort \u2014 on Thursday to try breathing life into an infrastructure\
      \ plan his senior aides now say will take multiple years to bring about. The\
      \ White House hopes to get some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of his $1.5 trillion\
      \ package through Congress and signed into law this year. One senior administration\
      \ official said Wednesday that White House aides expect a \u2018strong push\u2019\
      \ to get a \u2018big chunk\u2019 of the infrastructure plan to his desk by the\
      \ end of 2018. \u2018We never anticipated this would be a quick or easy process,\u2019\
      \ the senior official said. \u2018The president is in this for the long haul,\u2019\
      \ he added, saying the White House now expects parts of the package will have\
      \ to wait for legislative action next year. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said\
      \ recently he intends to move an infrastructure overhaul package in multiple\
      \ bills. The senior administration official said the White House strongly supports\
      \ that approach.\u201D\n\nFederal disability claims included in spending bill\
      \ - WaPo: \u201CTucked inside the sweeping $1.3 trillion spending bill passed\
      \ late last week by Congress was an item that has not been in a budget for nearly\
      \ a decade: a funding increase for the Social Security Administration, an agency\
      \ bedeviled by staff shortages that have contributed to a crushing backlog of\
      \ disability claims stretching past 1 million. The omnibus appropriations bill\
      \ increased funding to the federal agency by $480 million, bringing its overall\
      \ administrative budget to more than $12 billion. Roughly $100 million of the\
      \ increased allocation will target the disability hearing backlog, in which\
      \ claimants on average wait around 600 days for a judge to decide whether they\
      \ will receive benefits including health insurance and a monthly payment. The\
      \ funding comes amid a hardening stance across the nation toward recipients\

      \ of Easter weekend, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano\
      \ discusses the connection between personal freedom and rising from the dead:\
      \ \u201CFreedom is the ability of every person to exercise free will without\
      \ a government permission slip or watchdog. Free will is a natural characteristic\
      \ we share in common with God. He created us in His image and likeness. As He\
      \ is perfectly free, so are we. When the government takes away free will, whether\
      \ by fiat or by majority vote, it steals a gift we received from God; it violates\
      \ the natural law; it prevents us from having and utilizing the means to seek\
      \ the truth. \u2026 We know, from events 2,000 years ago that Christians commemorate\
      \ this week, that freedom is the essential means to discover and unite with\
      \ the truth.\u201D More here .\n\nAUDIBLE: THAT\u2019S A COMPLIMENT FROM CHAOS\n\
      \n\u201CI heard you\u2019re actually the Devil incarnate and I wanted to meet\
      \ you.\u201D \u2013 Defense Secretary James Mattis upon meeting National Security\
      \ Adviser designate John Bolton at the White House today.\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\
      \n\u201CIn his opinion written for the majority in District of Columbia v. Heller,\
      \ Justice Scalia clearly and definitively discussed and explained the relationship\
      \ between the prefatory clause \u2018well regulated Militia\u2019 and the operative\
      \ clause \u2018the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u2019\
      \ Therefore, there is no \u2018tension,\u2019 as you put it, between the two\
      \ clauses to be debated. Presumably, that is why Justice Stevens (who wrote\
      \ for the dissent in Heller) now suggests that the Second Amendment be repealed\
      \ rather than suggesting that another amendment be passed to \u2018clarify\u2019\
      \ the Second Amendment.\u201D \u2013 C.M. Polk, Aberdeen, Md.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note:\
      \ I don\u2019t the former justice is at all interested in clarification. Rather,\
      \ I think he\u2019s interested in elimination. Similarly, I don\u2019t believe\
      \ that you see any tension between the clauses and that the \u201Cshall not\
      \ be infringed\u201D component trumps all. What I am arguing has nothing to\
      \ do with judicial scholarship, but rather with the inability of citizens to\
      \ exercise their single greatest power: To amend the Constitution to reflect\
      \ their desires. About the time when courts began treating the charter as \u201C\
      living\u201D in the sense that the words in the text were subject to historical\
      \ relativism, the American electorate stopped exercising the real living component\
      \ of the document. Did people stop amending the Constitution in the 1970s because\
      \ the courts were doing it for them or did the courts start changing the Constitution\
      \ because the people lost the facility to do so? The proportions between those\
      \ two dynamics are debatable, but I think the relationship is real. I want Americans\
      \ to get back to using the Constitution as it was intended, and when you\u2019\
      re having a debate over a constitutionally protected freedom I think we should\
      \ be talking about the real matter at hand, not how to circumvent the charter\
      \ through political or judicial maneuvering.]\n\n\n\nShare your color commentary:\

      \ board of directors Wednesday, she became at least the third high-ranking official\
      \ under former President Barack Obama to receive a top post at a tech giant\
      \ after leaving the White House.\n\nIn announcing Rice's appointment, Netflix\
      \ co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings said the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N.\
      \ had \"tackled difficult, complex global issues with intelligence, integrity\
      \ and insight.\"\n\nRice's appointment was met with outrage from some conservatives.\
      \ Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Netflix had \"[doubled] down in support\
      \ of Obama corruption\" by hiring Rice, a controversial figure in the aftermath\
      \ of the 2012 Benghazi attack, as well as the \"unmasking\" controversy surrounding\
      \ members of the Trump campaign.\n\nNational Rifle Association spokesman Dana\
      \ Loesch said Netflix was \"[t]he perfect place for a former staffer who blamed\
      \ a terror attack on a poorly-made short film released long before said attack\
      \ took place,\" a reference to Rice initially blaming the Benghazi attack on\
      \ an anti-Muslim YouTube video.\n\nBut Rice isn't the only Obama alum benefiting\
      \ here. David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to Obama, was hired by ridesharing\
      \ company Uber in August 2014 to be its senior vice president of policy and\
      \ strategy. This past January, Plouffe was lured away from Uber by Facebook\
      \ founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to help run his Chan Zuckerberg social advocacy\
      \ organization.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Jay Carney has settled\

      \ 2014 and spent six months as a political analyst at CNN, joined Amazon in\
      \ March 2015 as senior vice president for corporate affairs.\n\nAmazon is a\

      \ [using] our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to\
      \ the U.S.), and ... putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\"\n\
      \nConservatives have long criticized tech companies for disregarding and shunning\
      \ their viewpoints. During a recent debate at Stanford University, PayPal co-founder\
      \ Peter Thiel described Silicon Valley as \"a one-party state.\"\n\n\"The other\

    text: 'A former Maryland state senator pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court
      to two counts of fraud for accepting $15,300 in bribes.


      Nathanial Oaks, a 71-year-old Baltimore Democrat, entered guilty pleas to one
      count of wire fraud and one count of honest services fraud, hours after he resigned
      from office. He faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the two counts.


      U.S. District Court Judge Richard Bennett said other charges, including obstruction
      of justice, would be dismissed under a plea deal with prosecutors. The judge
      scheduled sentencing for July 17. Oaks pleaded guilty to taking the bribes from
      an FBI informant posing as a Texas investor looking to obtain contracts in Baltimore.


      "Yes," Oaks said, when asked by the judge if he had committed the crimes.


      Oaks and his attorneys declined to comment as they entered and left the courthouse.


      The case arose from an investigation dating to 2015, when Oaks was a member
      of the Maryland House of Delegates. In the plea agreement, Oaks admitted he
      issued two letters on his office letterhead in 2016 that contained false and
      fraudulent representations to a person he believed to be a U.S. Housing and
      Urban Development official. The letters were sent to help obtain federal grant
      funds for the FBI informant, who went by the name Mike Henley. Henley paid Oaks
      $10,300 for his help.


      Henley paid Oaks another $5,000 in exchange for Oaks'' agreement to file a bond
      bill request with the Maryland Department of Legislative Services seeking $250,000
      in state funds for a development project.


      The money paid to Oaks was supplied by the FBI. Meetings between Oaks and the
      informant were recorded with audio and video recording equipment.


      Court records describe Oaks as being careful not to openly talk about payments.
      During an April 2016 meeting when the two discussed ways Oaks could help, the
      lawmaker put a lollipop in his mouth. The source then held up five fingers to
      signify a $5,000 payment. Oaks then shook his head from side to side and made
      an upward motion with his thumb to indicate a higher amount, court records say.
      He also used code words with the informant to set bribe amounts. Court records
      say the informant and Oaks had settled on "lollipop" as a code word for $1,000,
      stemming from the time he put the Tootsie Pop in his mouth to halt open discussion
      of monetary amounts.


      Oaks confessed to two FBI agents in January 2017 that he accepted the payments,
      and he agreed to cooperate with the FBI in an investigation of another person.
      As part of that investigation, Oaks covertly recorded his phone conversations
      with the person, but in March he tipped off the target of the probe during a
      meeting in an Annapolis bar and told him: "What we talked about, just say no."
      Oaks warned the target again later that month in the hallway of a state government
      building in the state capital.


      Because of the tip off, the investigation into the target and possibly other
      politicians was no longer viable, the U.S. attorney''s office said.


      Oaks'' indictment last year came amid a flurry of state and federal charges
      against would-be, former and sitting lawmakers who ended up in legal trouble.
      Gary Brown, a Democrat, was indicted by state prosecutors early last year on
      charges of making illegal campaign contributions, one day before he was scheduled
      to be sworn in as a Baltimore delegate. A day later, federal prosecutors announce
      a former delegate, William Campos, had pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy
      in a public corruption case involving the liquor industry in Prince George''s
      County. And the very next day, just before the legislative session started,
      another Prince George''s County Democrat, Del. Michael Vaughn, abruptly announced
      his resignation. Vaughn was indicted in the same federal case as Campos.


      Oaks represented Baltimore in the House from 1983 until early 1989. In 1988,
      he was convicted of theft and misconduct in office charges for stealing thousands
      of dollars from his re-election fund. He received a five-year suspended sentence
      and lost his House seat as a result. But in 1994, Oaks was re-elected to the
      House, where he served until last year, when he was appointed to replace a senator
      who retired.


      Oaks, whose indictment became public nearly a year ago, remained in office while
      he faced the charges. He submitted his resignation letter Wednesday night with
      an effective date of 9 a.m. Thursday. The Senate president removed him from
      his position on the Senate Finance Committee last month, at the recommendation
      of a legislative ethics panel.'

      \ \u201Ctraumatic\u201D experience.\n\nSpeaking at Rutgers University Thursday,\
      \ Clinton spoke primarily about being a woman in politics \u2014 and being targeted\
      \ as a result, the problem Republicans face as a disjointed unit, the upcoming\
      \ elections and her hopes that the recent events under the Trump administration\
      \ would motivate people enough to vote for change.\n\nWhen asked about being\
      \ told to get off the public stage and \u201Cshut up,\u201D Clinton said she\
      \ was \u201Cstruck\u201D by the fact that \u201Cthey never said that to any\
      \ man,\u201D citing unsourced research from \u201Cone of the young people\u201D\
      \ on her staff.\n\nClinton also mentioned being called \u201Cshrill\u201D by\

      \ to be themselves the way men are allowed to be themselves,\u201D she said.\n\
      \nThe former secretary of state also said she\u2019s regretted some things she\

      \ from a university endowment, NJ.com reported.\n\nClinton also took the opportunity\
      \ to bash the Republican Party saying it slowly was coming undone by \u201C\
      a very small group of powerful forces,\u201D who could fund another candidate\
      \ if one does not appeal to the \u201Cfar right.\u201D She said she was referring\

      \ retirement or that have said that they will not seek reelection.\n\n\u201C\
      They\u2019re leaving,\u201D she said, \u201Cbecause they know they will be shown\
      \ no understanding by the hard right and the money that funds it.\u201D\n\n\
      Clinton also took jabs at the Trump administration ahead of the important 2018\
      \ midterm elections, although she mentioned Donald Trump by name only once,\
      \ but alluded to him several other times.\n\n\u201CI really hope this is a turning\

    text: "Kentucky lawmakers passed a pension reform bill Thursday, sending it to\
      \ Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s desk -- but also prompting backlash about the speed\
      \ of its passage, reports said.\n\nThe proposed pension overhaul would preserve\
      \ benefits for most workers, but do little to address the state\u2019s massive\
      \ debt.\n\nThe 291-page proposal came up for a vote suddenly Thursday, taking\
      \ the place of a sewage bill that was on the docket.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House\
      \ approved the bill 49-46, and the Senate later passed it, 22-15, as about 200\
      \ teachers and other opponents chanted \"Shame on you\" from outside the chambers,\
      \ the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.\n\nBevin defended the passage of\
      \ bill.\n\n\"Tonight 49 members of the Kentucky House and 22 members of the\
      \ Kentucky Senate voted not to keep kicking the pension problem down the road,\"\
      \ the governor tweeted, but it was not clear when he planned to sign it.\n\n\
      The bill came up so quickly that some lawmakers signaled that they didn't know\
      \ how it would financially affect the state. Republican Rep. John \"Bam\" Carney\
      \ said lawmakers expect the plan to save $300 million over the next 30 years.\
      \ But Kentucky is at least $41 billion short of the money it needs to pay retirement\
      \ benefits over that same time.\n\n\"There was some hope that some of the things\
      \ we could do in pension reform could make a larger impact on that future liability,\
      \ but at the end of the day there just wasn't the will to do that,\" Acting\
      \ House Speaker David Osborne said.\n\nMorgan Taylor, a 28-year-old high school\
      \ chemistry teacher from Rockcastle County, told the Courier-Journal that lawmakers\
      \ had \"clearly not had time to even read\" the bill before voting.\n\n\"As\
      \ a teacher, I would never, ever give my students something that I haven't read\
      \ myself,\" she said. \"I think a select group of people know what's in this\
      \ (bill) and everyone else is just expected to toe the line.\"\n\nAs of 10:30\
      \ p.m. local time, the bill had not been posted online for the public to read,\
      \ FOX 41 reported.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tom Burch, reflecting the impassioned\
      \ pleas among teachers and public workers, called the bill \"garbage\" as he\
      \ slammed it on the table during a hastily called committee meeting Thursday.\n\
      \n\"This bill is going to be found unconstitutional,\" Democratic Rep. Derrick\
      \ Graham said, according to FOX 41. \"Remember this day. Let your voices be\
      \ heard in November, for those that were with you in the grind and those who\
      \ were against you.\"\n\nThe bill removes some of the most vilified provisions\
      \ of previous proposals. Current and retired teachers, who are not eligible\
      \ for Social Security benefits, would still get annual raises of 1.5 percent\
      \ in their retirement checks. Current workers would not have to work longer\
      \ to qualify for full benefits.\n\nBut new hires would be moved to a hybrid\
      \ plan. They would be guaranteed to get back all of the money they and taxpayers\
      \ contributed to their retirement accounts, plus 85 percent of any investment\
      \ gains. The state would keep the other 15 percent.\n\nTeachers told the Courier-Journal\
      \ that the bill would significantly diminish benefits for future teachers and\
      \ discourage young people from considering teaching as a career.\n\n\u201CHow\
      \ are you going to attract and keep good teachers in the state when they don\u2019\
      t have a retirement?\u201D Holbrook asked.\n\nAlmost immediately after the bill's\
      \ passage, Fayette County Public Schools announced that classes would be canceled\
      \ Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

    text: "This is how the firing of the VA secretary could have been framed:\n\n\
      David Shulkin had gotten himself in a heap of trouble. The inspector general\
      \ had spanked him for a $120,000 trip to Europe, changing a pretext so his wife\u2019\
      s airfare would be covered, and improperly accepting Wimbledon tickets.\n\n\
      What\u2019s more, Shulkin had gone to war with some of his top deputies, was\
      \ increasingly isolated at the department, and the president concluded he had\
      \ to make a change.\n\nNow some of that information was included in the B matter\
      \ of various stories, but the main media themes are:\n\nMore chaos at the White\
      \ House!\n\nAnd how dare Donald Trump replace him with his personal doctor?\n\
      \nShulkin, as the New York Times noted, also generated bad publicity when he\
      \ tried to salvage his job by warning about aides \"trying to undermine the\
      \ department from within.\"\n\nShulkin did rack up some accomplishments on the\
      \ reform front. My main discomfort with the dismissal is that Trump let him\
      \ twist in the wind for weeks\u2014as he did with Rex Tillerson\u2014while damaging\
      \ leaks made clear he was on the way out. Of course, Shulkin could have seen\
      \ the handwriting and resigned.\n\n(And yes, it's ironic that Trump once proclaimed\
      \ that he'd never have to use his signature \"you're fired\" line against Shulkin.)\n\
      \nShulkin, a former hospital executive, fired back in a New York Times op-ed\
      \ that called the atmosphere in Washington \"toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and\
      \ subversive.\" He complained that he had \"been falsely accused of things by\
      \ people who wanted me out of the way ... It should not be this hard to serve\
      \ your country.\"\n\nThere was a policy dispute at the heart of this battle,\
      \ with Shulkin resisting efforts to privatize more VA services, which he said\
      \ was \"aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if\
      \ it undermines care for veterans.\" The counter-argument is that the overstretched\
      \ VA system can't provide enough effective care, as we saw with the waiting-list\
      \ scandal.\n\nBut if a Cabinet member disagrees with his boss on such a fundamental\
      \ principle, his days are usually numbered.\n\nTrump is taking some heat from\
      \ the media and from critics for handing the job to Ronny Jackson, his White\

    text: "A federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., who has called the Trump administration's\
      \ immigration policy \"heartless,\" ruled Thursday that a lawsuit seeking to\
      \ preserve the federal DACA program can continue -- citing candidate Donald\
      \ Trump's \"racial slurs\" and \"epithets.\"\n\nIn a fiery ruling, U.S. District\
      \ Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who was appointed to the bench by former President\
      \ Bill Clinton, shot down the government's motion to dismiss the case.\n\nGaraufis\
      \ said Trump's \"overt expressions of prejudice\" during the 2016 presidential\
      \ election suggest that his attempts to roll back DACA since taking office in\
      \ January 2017 were unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious -- a high standard\
      \ rarely invoked to override executive action.\n\n\u201COne might reasonably\
      \ infer,\u201D the judge wrote, \u201Cthat a candidate who makes overtly bigoted\
      \ statements on the campaign trail might be more likely to engage in similarly\
      \ bigoted action in office.\u201D\n\n\"I\u2019m just glad I was born in Paterson,\
      \ New Jersey, and not in Mexico City.\" - U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis\n\
      \nDACA (Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals) is an Obama-era program designed\
      \ to delay the deportations of people who came to the U.S. illegally as children.\
      \ President Trump has expressed interest in ending the program.\n\nThe plaintiffs,\
      \ who include state Democratic attorneys general and other lawyers, won an injunction\
      \ from Garaufis in February that preserved DACA while the suit proceeded. That\
      \ injunction resembled an earlier one effected by a California court.\n\nGaraufis'\
      \ injunction did not require the government to accept new DACA applications.\
      \ At the time, Garaufis said he was \"sympathetic\u201D to those who could not\
      \ apply in time.\n\nSESSIONS SLAMS 'ACTIVIST JUDGES' FOR NATIONWIDE DACA INJUNCTIONS\n\
      \nGaraufis has a history of taking an unusually emotional, political approach\
      \ to his cases.\n\nIn September, he publicly excoriated a Justice Department\
      \ lawyer arguing for a DACA renewal deadline.\n\n\u201CThis is a democracy;\
      \ these people have thrived in America, and you can\u2019t just come into court\
      \ and espouse a position that is so heartless,\u201D Garaufis said in the courtroom.\
      \ \u201CI\u2019m 68 years old, and I\u2019ve worked in every branch of government,\
      \ and I\u2019ve never seen a position like this.\u201D\n\nHe continued by suggesting\
      \ that the Trump administration is motivated by xenophobia.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
      s unacceptable, quite frankly, to me, as a human being and as an American,\"\
      \ he said at the hearing. \"I\u2019m just glad I was born in Paterson, New Jersey,\
      \ and not in Mexico City.\"\n\nWHAT IS DACA, AND WHAT IS TRUMP DOING WITH IT?\n\
      \nIn 2013, a New York federal appeals court removed Garaufis from handling aspects\
      \ of a lawsuit alleging discrimination by the New York City Fire Department,\
      \ saying he appeared to be too biased.\n\nIn that case, Garaufis ordered the\
      \ department to implement racial quotas, and called evidence of improper discrimination\
      \ \"incredible.\"\n\nThe appeals court found that \u201Can objective observer\
      \ would have a reasonable basis to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in\
      \ assessing that evidence at trial.\u201D"

      \ Facebook friends list with their smartphone's contacts list \u2013 in a bid\
      \ to reach those people and persuade them to vote for Clinton.\n\nIn the midst\
      \ of the election, the Clinton campaign launched a mobile application called\
      \ \u201CHillary 2016\u201D that worked its way around the banned practice of\
      \ gathering information from users\u2019 friends without their consent.\n\n\
      The Clinton campaign\u2019s use of big data raises concerns amid controversy\
      \ surrounding Cambridge Analytica, a data-driven company with ties to the Trump\
      \ campaign that was accused of mining Facebook data and using it to target potential\
      \ voters.\n\nBut a spokesman for Clinton pushed back against any comparisons\
      \ with Cambridge Analytica, telling Fox News that the campaign\u2019s mobile\
      \ application merely \u201Clet users contact their friends about the campaign.\u201D\
      \n\nTrump and Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, the Clinton spokesman charged,\
      \ used \u201Cstolen\u201D data \u201Cfor a purpose that was entirely misrepresented\
      \ to Facebook.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s the difference between someone asking\
      \ you to carpool versus them stealing your car,\u201D he said.\n\nPresident\
      \ Donald Trump, however, recently reminded the public that his social media\
      \ operation was viewed during the campaign as being less expensive and less\
      \ sophisticated than Clinton's.\n\nFacebook did not respond to a request for\
      \ a comment.\n\nThe social networking giant banned the practice of acquiring\
      \ users\u2019 friends lists in 2014 after former President Barack Obama\u2019\
      s campaign weaponized the method and got access to the data of millions of potential\
      \ voters.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s application took advantage of special iPhone\
      \ and Facebook integration, asking every user to pair their friends list on\
      \ Facebook with their phone contacts \u2013 and give the campaign permission\
      \ to access that info.\n\nPeople who didn\u2019t download the application weren\u2019\
      t able to stop friends from pairing their phone numbers with Facebook accounts\
      \ if their friends decided to do so.\n\nOnce the friends list was paired with\
      \ the app, people had to swipe through their Facebook friends and dismiss those\
      \ who, in their view, would never vote for Clinton. Once that was done, the\
      \ remaining friends were sorted by location and the users could send a pre-written\
      \ text message to convince them to back Clinton in numerous ways.\n\nKey developers\
      \ of the application either declined to comment or did not respond to Fox News\u2019\
      \ requests for interviews.\n\nThe campaign said at the time that more than 150,000\
      \ people downloaded the application on their devices \u2013 meaning that millions\
      \ of people\u2019s information may have been harvested through the app.\n\n\
      Politico was the first to provide an in-depth review of the app, but just a\
      \ month before the election, nobody perceived the application as potentially\
      \ invasive and, in fact, lauded it as an impressive election technology.\n\n\
      LIBERAL MEDIA DIDN\u2019T THINK DATA MINING WAS SO BAD WHEN OBAMA\u2019S CAMPAIGN\
      \ DID IT\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the campaign used the acquired\
      \ data, though Clinton hired Elan Kriegel \u2013 the battleground states analytics\
      \ director for Obama 2012 and mastermind behind using big data \u2013 to decide\
      \ which voters would be targeted for campaign messages and in what ways.\n\n\
      For the 2016 race, Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook\
      \ ads, according to Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who revealed the\
      \ sum during a congressional hearing last year."

      \ in Southern California, a court spokesperson confirmed. He was 87.\n\nReinhardt\
      \ died of a heart attack during a visit to a dermatologist in Los Angeles, the\
      \ court spokesperson said.\n\n\u201CAs a judge, he was deeply principled, fiercely\
      \ passionate about the law and fearless in his decisions,\u201D 9th Circuit\
      \ Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said in a statement. \u201CHe will be remembered\
      \ as one of the giants of the federal bench.\u201D\n\nEric Garcetti, Mayor of\
      \ Los Angeles, called Reinhardt \"one of the greatest jurists of our time. A\
      \ searingly brilliant Angeleno and true progressive icon.\"\n\nReinhardt was\
      \ appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 and went on to become the sixth\
      \ longest-serving judge on the court.\n\nReinhardt was a liberal stalwart on\
      \ the bench, which he used to try to help the underdog, including immigrants\
      \ and minorities, The Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nLast year he wrote in an\
      \ opinion that a Trump administration order to deport a man who entered the\
      \ country illegally nearly three decades ago and became a respected businessman\
      \ in Hawaii was \u201Cinhumane\u201D and \u201Ccontrary to the values of the\
      \ country and its legal system.\u201D\n\nIn 2012, he wrote an opinion that struck\
      \ down California\u2019s gay marriage ban. He also wrote a 1996 opinion that\
      \ struck down a Washington state law that prohibited doctors from prescribing\
      \ medication to help terminally ill patients die.\n\n\u201CHe was a giant --\
      \ not just on the 9th Circuit, but within the law,\u201D University of California,\
      \ Berkeley, law school Dean Erwin Chemerinsky told The Times. \u201CHe also\
      \ was a judge with a particular vision of the law, based on enforcing the Constitution\
      \ to protect people.\u201D\n\nHe was among the federal judges who decided that\
      \ overcrowding in California\u2019s prison system was unconstitutional.\n\n\
      Reinhardt joined another judge in ruling that the words \u201Cunder God\u201D\
      \ in the Pledge of Allegiance were unconstitutional, a decision that was later\
      \ overturned.\n\nHector Villagra, executive director of the American Civil Liberties\
      \ Union of Southern California and a former Reinhardt clerk, called Reinhardt's\
      \ death \"devastating,\" The Times reported.\n\nHe recalled the judge working\
      \ in his chambers at 11 p.m. on a Saturday writing a dissent to the court\u2019\
      s decision not to rehear a death penalty appeal.\n\n\"He knew it was totally\
      \ pointless,\" Villagra said. \"It wasn't going to affect the outcome. But it\
      \ was the right thing to do, and that's what mattered. He wanted his voice and\
      \ his objections heard.\"\n\nAfter serving two years in the U.S. Air Force,\
      \ Reinhardt served as a clerk for a federal judge in the District of Columbia,\
      \ then entered private practice in Los Angeles. He served on the Los Angeles\
      \ Police Commission from 1975 until his appointment to the 9th Circuit.\n\n\
      He was born in 1931 in New York. His grandfather fled Nazi Germany, which inspired\
      \ Reinhardt to \u201Cbe vigilant in upholding human rights,\u201D The Times\
      \ reported.\n\nReinhardt is survived by his wife, Ramona Ripston, the former\
      \ director of the ACLU of Southern California; three adult children, Mark Reinhardt,\
      \ 57, a professor of political science at Williams College; Justin Reinhardt,\
      \ 52, a musician; and Dana Reinhardt, 47, a novelist; and seven grandchildren.\n\
      \nHis family has asked that, in lieu of flowers, donations in Reinhardt's memory\
      \ may be made to the ACLU, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\nHis death creates a new\
      \ vacancy on the 9th Circuit, which President Trump will now be able to fill\

      s border wall, telling reporters that \u201Cwalls work\u201D and that \u201C\
      agents know it.\u201D\n\nActing Deputy Commissioner Ronald Vitiello told reporters\
      \ that agents have repeatedly said that a mix of technology, infrastructure\
      \ and access to the border are what is necessary to keep the border secure.\
      \ An important part of this would be effective barriers, and he said that such\
      \ requests came from the field.\n\n\u201CThe truth is that walls work and the\
      \ data show it and agents know it,\u201D he said.\n\nVitiello told reporters\
      \ that the CBP was appreciative of the $1.6 billion funding given to border\
      \ security measures in the omnibus spending bill and it would fund 100 miles\
      \ of \u201Cborder wall system.\u201D\n\nBut he also noted that it was given\
      \ to them in different ways with different priorities than had been requested,\
      \ adding, \u201Cit does not fully fund our needs in the most critical locations.\u201D\
      \n\nHe also said they are \"still considering\" restrictive language in the\
      \ appropriations bill and what that means for current projects.\n\nHe added\
      \ that money, which he called a \"down-payment,\" will be funding construction\
      \ and repair in areas including San Diego, Calexico, and Santa Theresa, New\
      \ Mexico. He said that the Calexico project started last week.\n\nPresident\
      \ Trump objected to the $1.3 trillion omnibus bill due to the lack of funding\
      \ for border security, and has been looking into the possibility of getting\
      \ the military to fund the approximately $25 billion project.\n\nConservatives\
      \ noted that the bill limited the approximately 100 miles of new construction\
      \ and repairs to already approved models -- not the prototypes Trump recently\
      \ viewed in California.\n\nWhile Vitiello noted that a lot of the 100 miles\
      \ was replacement, he said it was new construction and that some parts are moving\
      \ from old, often dilapidated fencing to 30-foot steel bollard designs. He said\
      \ that, for instance, in El Paso a three-foot vehicle barrier was being replaced\
      \ by \"18 or 30 foot wall.\"\n\nOn what needs to be done, Vitiello said that\
      \ that the entire wall project would cover approximately 1,000 miles with various\
      \ wall structures, he believed $25 billion in funding would adequately fund\
      \ that project. He said that from the testing of the prototypes, a new design\
      \ standard was being formulated that would be used going forward. Currently,\
      \ approximately 654 miles of the border are covered by some form of fencing\
      \ or barrier .\n\nVitiello's remarks come a day after Trump touted the early\
      \ stages of construction at a speech in Richfield, Ohio.\n\n\"We started our\
      \ wall \u2014 what a thing of beauty,\u201D Trump said, noting critics suggested\
      \ he would \u201Cgive up.\u201D \u201CHas he given up? No I never give up.\u201D\

      \ attorney\n\nMcCabe, who spent more than 20 years at the FBI, was fired earlier\
      \ this month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the DOJ\u2019s inspector\
      \ general determined McCabe was not truthful during his review of the Clinton\
      \ email investigation. The FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility\
      \ recommended his firing.\n\nOn Thursday, he set up a GoFundMe page to crowd\
      \ source donations for his legal defense fund. In less than a day, it raised\
      \ more than $400,000, including from many small donations of $5 and $10. The\
      \ GoFundMe page makes an apparent appeal to anti- Trump activists.\n\n\u201C\
      His reward for that has been a termination that was completely unjustified,\
      \ amidst repeated ad hominem attacks by the President of the United States,\u201D\
      \ the fundraising page reads.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s GoFundMe says a legal defense\
      \ fund is needed because he will likely have to respond to congressional inquiries,\
      \ as well as the Department of Justice\u2019s Inspector General Investigation\
      \ and \u201Cany potential lawsuits he might consider.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, Flynn,\

      \ wake of his prosecution.\n\nFLYNN SELLING HOME TO PAY FOR LEGAL FEES AFTER\
      \ PLEADING GUILTY IN TRUMP PROBE\n\n\"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this has\
      \ been a trying experience,\u201D his youngest brother, Joe Flynn, recently\
      \ told ABC News. \"It has been a crucible and it's not over.\"\n\nFlynn was\
      \ fired from the White House last year for misleading Vice President Mike Pence\
      \ about his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador and then pleaded guilty\
      \ to lying to the FBI. A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional\
      \ pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a\
      \ drawn-out court battle.\n\nFlynn\u2019s siblings set up a legal defense fund\
      \ for the former Trump administration official to collect donations from supporters,\
      \ though have not used a crowd funding platform like GoFundMe that reveals how\
      \ much money has been raised.\n\nFamily members of the retired three-star Army\
      \ general recently said he put his home in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria\
      \ \u2014 just outside Washington, D.C. \u2014 on the market in December with\
      \ an asking price of $895,000 to help pay his legal bills.\n\nABC News reported\
      \ that Flynn has since moved back to Rhode Island.\n\nAn attorney for Flynn\
      \ declined to comment. Barbara Redgate, Flynn's sister who set up the legal\
      \ defense fund, did not immediately return a message Friday asking how much\
      \ money has been raised.\n\nBut Flynn's siblings have said any money made from\
      \ the sale of the Virginia home will go toward Flynn\u2019s legal fees.\n\n\"\
      The costs of legal representation associated with responding to the multiple\
      \ investigations that have arisen in the wake of the 2016 election place a great\
      \ burden on Mike and his family,\" the website for the legal fund says.\n\n\

    text: "Citing a disturbing trend of new soldiers lacking both proper discipline\
      \ and physical fitness, senior U.S. Army leaders are calling for a tougher and\
      \ longer basic training program to prepare troops for combat over the next decade.\n\
      \n\u201CWe have every reason to get this right, and far fewer reasons not to,\u201D\
      \ Secretary of the Army Mark Esper said at the Association of the United States\
      \ Army's Global Force Symposium in Alabama on Monday. \u201CThat\u2019s why\
      \ we are considering several initiatives \u2014 from a new physical fitness\
      \ regime to reforming and extending basic training \u2014 in order to ensure\
      \ our young men and women are prepared for the rigors of high-intensity combat.\u201D\
      \n\nWhile Esper didn\u2019t divulge any details of what an extended Basic Combat\
      \ Training (BCT) might look like, the Army has already floated the idea of adding\
      \ two weeks to its 10-week program. A redesigned BCT is expected to be implemented\
      \ by early summer.\n\nThe current BCT involves a three-stage process, the first\
      \ of which is the \u201CRed Phase.\u201D Comprising the first three weeks of\
      \ training, it's where recruits begin to learn drills and ceremonies, the seven\
      \ \u201CArmy Core Values, unarmed combat and first aid. Recruits are also introduced\
      \ to standard-issue weapons like the M-16 assault rifle and M-4 carbine.\n\n\
      In Phase 2, known as the \u201CWhite Phase,\u201D soldiers begin target practice\
      \ with their rifles, and become acquainted with other weapons like grenade launchers\
      \ and machine guns. The recruits also complete a timed obstacle course and learn\
      \ to work alongside other soldiers.\n\nThe final phase, or \u201CBlue Phase,\u201D\
      \ sees the soldiers complete the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), learn nighttime\
      \ combat operations and go on 10- and 15-kilometer field marches. After passing\
      \ all their tests, the recruits graduate from basic training and move on to\
      \ Advanced Individual Training, where they focus on specific skills in their\
      \ field.\n\n\u201CThe ultimate goal of the military is to strip a civilian of\
      \ civilian status and to put them in a military mindset,\u201D Mike Volkin,\
      \ an Iraq war veteran and author of \u201CThe Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook,\u201D\
      \ told Fox News. \u201CSo if you were to boil down the goal of basic training\
      \ to its essence it would be to conform.\u201D\n\nThe new BCT will place an\
      \ added focus on strict discipline and esprit de corps through a greater emphasis\
      \ on drills and ceremony, inspections and military history. It will also concentrate\
      \ heavily on crucial battlefield skills such as marksmanship, physical fitness,\
      \ first aid and communications.\n\nAlong with the new BCT regimen, U.S. Army\
      \ brass is considering a tougher Combat Readiness Test, which would replace\
      \ the current three-event APFT with a six-event test Army leaders believe better\
      \ prepares recruits for the physical challenges of the service's Warrior Tasks\
      \ and Battle Drills \u2013 the key skills soldiers use to help them survive\
      \ in combat.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s going to be a much greater emphasis on fitness,\u201D\
      \ Volkin said. \u201CThroughout the history of basic training, it\u2019s always\
      \ been about push-ups, sit-ups and the two-mile run, and that\u2019s not a true\
      \ test of fitness. This six-point test focuses more on core strength and cardio.\u201D\
      \n\nSpeaking at the AUSA meeting this week, Esper said that to meet the challenges\
      \ the U.S. military faces in the next decade \u2013 both in combating terrorism\
      \ and potentially facing off against other large and highly trained militaries\
      \ \u2013 the Army must also reverse its 2017 drawdown. The Army requested 4,000\
      \ additional soldiers be added to active forces as part of the 2019 fiscal budget\
      \ \u2013 a move that would swell the ranks to 487,000 active-duty soldiers \u2013\
      \ with the aim of having half a million active-duty soldiers battle-ready by\
      \ 2028.\n\n\"To meet the challenges of 2028 and beyond, the total Army must\
      \ grow,\" Esper said. \"A decade from now, we need an active component above\
      \ 500,000 soldiers with associated growth in the Guard and Reserve.\"\n\nBut\
      \ as the Army looks to expand its ranks, it will also become more selective\
      \ in who becomes a solider.\n\nGen. James McConville, the Army's vice chief\
      \ of staff, told Military.com that the service is considering revising its screening\
      \ process to better prepare recruits for basic training and beyond.\n\nBesides\
      \ screening candidates\u2019 physical fitness before they begin BCT, the Army\
      \ would screen them again at the start of training to make sure they can meet\
      \ the physical demands, and is even testing the idea of assigning fitness experts\
      \ to two divisions.\n\n\"We are putting physical therapists, we are putting\
      \ strength coaches, we are putting dietitians into each of the units, so when\
      \ the [new] soldiers get there, we continue to keep them in shape as they go\
      \ forward,\" McConville said. \"We are going to have to take what we have, we\
      \ are going to have to develop that talent and we are going to bring them in\
      \ and make them better.\u201D"

      \ is said to have physically harmed and threatened to \u201Ckill\u201D another\
      \ staffer -- letting him keep working for her office for months.\n\nRep. Elizabeth\
      \ Etsy came under fire on Thursday after a report in the CTPost.com said that\
      \ her former chief of staff, Tony Baker, had allegedly called a young female\
      \ staffer, with whom he had a romantic relationship, nearly 50 times on May\
      \ 5, 2016, and had once punched her in the back in Etsy\u2019s Washington office\
      \ and threatened her discourage a report.\n\nAn affidavit obtained by the Post\
      \ said the woman, Anna Kain \u2013 who has since gone public \u2013 felt \u201C\
      intimidated\u201D by Baker, which led her to keep quiet for fear of jeopardizing\
      \ her own safety.\n\n\"Throughout the Winter of 2014, respondent (Baker) repeatedly\
      \ screamed at petitioner (the former staffer) in the workplace, making the woman\
      \ feel intimidated and caused petitioner to feel she could not report respondent\u2019\
      s actions without putting her safety at risk,\u201D according to the affidavit.\n\
      \nKain also provided a copy of a threating voicemail that Baker left on her\
      \ phone to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201CYou better f-----g reply to me or I\
      \ will f-----g kill you,\u201D Baker disturbingly said on the night that he\
      \ reportedly attempted to reach Kain nearly 50 times.\n\nEtsy became aware of\
      \ the situation within a week but, rather than firie the man, she met with lawyers,\
      \ The Post reported, citing emails.\n\nThose emails revealed that Etsy did meet\
      \ with Kain, who gave a detailed description of the alleged sexual harassment\
      \ and abuse that took place throughout 2014.\n\nBut Baker remained on Etsy\u2019\
      s staff for three months and even accompanied her to the Democratic National\
      \ Convention in Philadelphia on July 25, 2016.\n\nHe sent an email on Aug. 12\
      \ announcing his departure.\n\nDocuments provided by Etsy to The Post further\
      \ revealed that after his departure, Baker was given a letter of recommendation,\
      \ multiple secrecy provisions surrounding his reasons for leaving and a severance\
      \ payment of $5,000.\n\nEtsy debates the letter of recommendation saying it\
      \ was \u201Climited\u201D and added that she was forced to sign and NDA by the\
      \ Office of House Employment Counsel, which she claims delayed Baker\u2019s\
      \ firing.\n\nA spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee,\
      \ Chris Martin, issued a statement slamming Etsy for \u201Corchestrating one\
      \ of the most disturbing Washington cover-ups in recent memory,\u201D and asking\
      \ for her resignation, The Hill reported.\n\nAn editorial in The Hartford Courant\
      \ also called for Etsy to resign.\n\n\u2018Ms. Etsy had every opportunity \u2014\
      \ and every responsibility \u2014 to at least suspend Mr. Baker on the spot\
      \ and hold him accountable for his behavior. Instead, she went with the script\
      \ that has cloaked sexual assault and harassment in Congress for decades. She\
      \ is complicit.\u201D\n\nFeeling pressure from Republicans to stand down, Etsy\
      \ released a statement to Facebook on Thursday, apologizing for \u201Cfailing\
      \ to protect\u201D Kain.\n\nShe apologized to the young female staffer and said\
      \ that it is her \u201Cresponsibility\u201D to uphold \u201Cequality and fairness.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CEquality and fairness are values I\u2019ve held long before I came\
      \ to Congress. Now that I am in Congress, it is my responsibility to run an\
      \ office that is not only safe, but upholds those values and respects staff\

      \nOn the roster: Mr. Jefferson\u2019s wager - Sessions rules out second special\
      \ counsel for now - Ryan undecided on reelection run - House Dem took it easy\
      \ on abusive chief of staff - Talk about a big brain freeze\n\nMR. JEFFERSON\u2019\
      S WAGER\n\nThomas Jefferson was, if anything, a man of self-confidence.\n\n\n\
      \nAnd lucky for us that he was. Who else but a cocksure person could have written\
      \ the American Creed \u2013 \u201CWe hold these truths to be self-evident\u2026\
      \u201D \u2013 at age 33 and as one of the youngest members of the Continental\
      \ Congress with the bold strokes that he did and make it stick?\n\n\n\nJefferson\u2019\
      s exuberant sense of himself extended to seemingly everything: architecture,\
      \ education, agriculture, foreign policy, cuisine, engineering and even religion.\n\
      \n\n\nLike many elites of his day and many of ours, Jefferson was a deist. He\
      \ believed that there was a God (probably) and that the understanding that came\
      \ to Abraham of God\u2019s unitary nature was true (probably). But while he\
      \ might have been baptized, married and buried in the Episcopal Church and attended\
      \ services regularly, it would be wrong to call him a Christian.\n\n\n\nJefferson\
      \ was a great admirer of Jesus of Nazareth, whose teachings Jefferson said were\
      \ \u201Cthe most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered\
      \ to man.\u201D The problem, as Jefferson the empiricist and gentleman scientist\
      \ saw it, was that the good teacher Jesus\u2019 works had been corrupted by\
      \ the \u201Cmere Abracadabra of the mountebanks calling themselves the priests\
      \ of Jesus.\u201D\n\n\n\nJefferson believed that scoundrels, starting with the\
      \ Apostle Paul, had cooked up the whole idea of Jesus\u2019 divinity as a scam\
      \ to fleece and control the weak and uneducated. In Jefferson\u2019s mind, the\
      \ pity of it all was that Jesus\u2019 sublime teachings and moral code had been\
      \ corrupted and obscured by these hustlers.\n\n\n\n\u201CIn extracting the pure\
      \ principles which he taught, we should have to strip off the artificial vestments\
      \ in which they have been muffled by priests,\u201D Jefferson wrote to his enemy\
      \ turned friend John Adams in 1813, \u201Cwho have travestied them into various\
      \ forms, as instruments of riches and power to themselves.\u201D\n\n\n\nJefferson\u2019\
      s solution was to produce a version of the New Testament of his own, one stripped\
      \ of miracles and prophecies, literally cutting and pasting passages from the\
      \ Christian Bible into a book of moral philosophy.\n\n\n\nIt took chutzpah to\
      \ stick your thumb in George III\u2019s eye, but stripping Jesus of his divinity\
      \ in the America of 1819 was another thing altogether. So Jefferson was careful\
      \ not to refer to his work as a \u201Cbible\u201D per se, instead calling his\
      \ book \u201CThe Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth Extracted Textually from\
      \ the Gospels.\u201D Wink, wink.\n\n\n\nJust as Christian believers pine for\
      \ what theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a condemned man writing from his cell\
      \ in a Nazi prison, called a \u201Creligionless Christianity\u201D rooted in\
      \ pure faith and love unobstructed by legalism, non-believers like Jefferson\
      \ have long yearned for faithless religion.\n\n\n\nThis was the challenge of\
      \ the Enlightenment, especially for those who believed that it was society and\
      \ institutions like churches that had corrupted man\u2019s basically good nature:\
      \ How can we obtain the benefits of religion \u2013 community, charity, morality,\
      \ education \u2013 if we do away with the fear of damnation?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019\
      s the same conversation that many Roman Catholics around the world are having\
      \ today after the Vatican\u2019s narrow non-denial denial that Pope Francis\
      \ observed that perhaps there is no Hell after all, but simply Heaven and oblivion.\
      \ Can you still get butts in the pews if there\u2019s no lake of fire into which\
      \ a sinner\u2019s soul might be cast?\n\n\n\nOn this Good Friday, millions of\
      \ American Christians heard and believed the words that at the death of their\
      \ crucified Lord, the barrier between God and mankind was finally torn asunder.\
      \ When the songs say \u201Cwere you there when they Crucified my Lord,\u201D\
      \ they feel as if they were and they \u201Ctremble, tremble, tremble.\u201D\n\
      \n\n\nOn Sunday, many millions more will hear and believe the good news that\
      \ sin and death have been defeated and that they too will be resurrected to\
      \ live in eternity in Heaven.\n\n\n\nBut for centuries, there have been many\
      \ Jeffersons in their midst, smirking to themselves as the \u201CAbracadabra\u201D\
      \ of it all, but playing along in the same way an older sibling might about\
      \ Santa Claus. It\u2019s fun for the kids and gives mom and dad a way to impose\
      \ order amid a hectic season, so why tear down the stockings?\n\n\n\nFor a growing\
      \ number of Americans, though, even paying lip service to these ideas doesn\u2019\
      t seem necessary anymore. With neither the eternal threat of damnation nor the\
      \ temporal sanction of shunning, Americans increasingly do as they please. Jefferson\u2019\
      s hope that there could be religiosity without faith has not materialized.\n\
      \n\n\nSince a republic is a system of government designed for a virtuous people,\
      \ this presents special problems. If people do not regulate themselves, order\
      \ will always eventually be imposed by other means.\n\n\n\nThe fear among American\
      \ conservatives has long been that a too-powerful government would fill the\
      \ voids left by weakened cultural institutions, but a different force is rising\
      \ in this age of moral imbecility when people, even the pious acting, have lost\
      \ the ability to understand right from wrong.\n\n\n\nJefferson would not have\
      \ seen the threat as clearly as his rivals in the north since he was most interested\
      \ in freeing (certain) people from the oppression of elites. But the Federalists\
      \ were ever warning that the rule of a king would be preferable to the rule\
      \ by the mob.\n\n\n\nIn this era of devolving social standards, Americans are\
      \ increasingly substituting the judgment of the mob for their own.\n\n\n\nConnectedness\
      \ has produced wonders the likes of which the Founders could not have imagines.\
      \ But it has also produced something they knew well and rightly feared: Clannish\
      \ factions that seek to stifle and destroy their enemies rather than live peacefully\
      \ under the blessings of liberty.\n\n\n\nOne wonders if Jefferson could see\
      \ us now if he wouldn\u2019t have gone a little lighter on the \u201CAbracadabra\u201D\
      \ stuff.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Whether this be Easter weekend, Passover, something\

      \ a federal prosecutor was evaluating certain issues involving the FBI, the\
      \ Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, but said he would not appoint a second\
      \ special counsel at this point. In a letter directed to Senate Judiciary Chairman\
      \ Chuck Grassley, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House\
      \ Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, Sessions revealed that he asked U.S.\
      \ Attorney John Huber to lead the evaluation into issues raised by the committees\
      \ in recent months. \u2018I write in response to recent letters requesting the\
      \ appointment of a Special Counsel to review certain prosecutorial and investigative\
      \ determinations made by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017. I take\
      \ the concerns you raise seriously,\u2019 Sessions wrote, noting how important\
      \ it was that the American people and Congress had \u2018confidence\u2019 in\
      \ the Justice Department.\u201D\n\nMcCabe soliciting online donations for legal\

      \ \u201CHillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign may have harvested\
      \ the Facebook data of millions of people using an app that asked them to pair\
      \ their Facebook friends list with their smartphone's contacts list \u2013 in\
      \ a bid to reach those people and persuade them to vote for Clinton. In the\
      \ midst of the election, the Clinton campaign launched a mobile application\
      \ called \u2018Hillary 2016\u2019 that worked its way around the banned practice\
      \ of gathering information from users\u2019 friends without their consent. The\

      \ to President Donald Trump, taking a fresh bipartisan step in their investigation\
      \ of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the\
      \ panel\u2019s chairman, and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a letter earlier\
      \ this week to the Trump campaign\u2019s attorney seeking emails from Rick Dearborn,\
      \ who went on to play a prominent role in the presidential transition before\
      \ reportedly leaving the White House earlier this year, and John Mashburn, who\
      \ served as the campaign\u2019s policy director and remains in the administration.\u201D\

      \ ambassador says he is at his wit\u2019s end. In a letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch\
      \ (R-Utah) earlier this month, Anatoly Antonov asked for help in obtaining meetings\
      \ with a slew of U.S. lawmakers and officials. The March 9 letter was written\
      \ two days after a POLITICO story detailed some of Antonov\u2019s travails in\
      \ securing meetings in Washington. \u2018I would be very grateful for your advice\
      \ on how to develop contacts with members of U.S. Congress, departments and\
      \ agencies, as well as for your possible assistance in setting up such meetings,\u2019\
      \ Antonov wrote in the letter, obtained by POLITICO. Hatch has previously confirmed\
      \ he met with Antonov, but a Hatch spokeswoman did not immediately reply for\
      \ comment on this story. The Russian Embassy also did not reply. A White House\

      \ I've essentially been doing for quite a long time, including, obviously, you\
      \ know, everything in Cleveland,\u2019 he said in interview on MSNBC\u2026 Page's\
      \ comments came hours after Reuters reported that investigators on special counsel\

      \ news channel will still be available via satellite, but two Washington-area\
      \ stations that carry it are set to suspend operations at midnight Saturday,\

      \ that even the simple question of whether he will seek re-election to his Wisconsin\
      \ seat remains secret. Officially, Ryan says he\u2019s still deciding. But a\
      \ person familiar with Ryan\u2019s thinking told The Associated Press this week\
      \ the speaker plans to file campaign paperwork and intends to win his seat.\
      \ To do so, the Republican would have to fend off primary challengers, including\
      \ one styled after President Donald Trump, and Democrats are fired up about\

      \ for a month -- to do intense homework and put a responsible plan of action\
      \ together in advance of the ill-conceived North Korean Summit. This venture\
      \ into the dark recesses of international intrigue is not for the faint of heart\
      \ or the ill-prepared. Ideally a non-partisan briefing team can be assembled,\
      \ both to prepare protocol and substantive positions on key issues. Just \u2018\
      gaming\u2019 the positions of North Korea and the many affected nations requires\
      \ unprecedented knowledge and expertise, not to mention lead time. Given America's\
      \ tenuous international stature, it is hard to imagine a positive outcome from\
      \ the May talks. So much is at stake, time's a-wasting, and so little preparation\
      \ seems to have done to date. Realistically, the best we can hope for is a series\
      \ of photo-ops, plenty of glad handing, and a promise to get together again\
      \ soon.\u201D \u2013 David Wiltsee, Applegate, Calif.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Birds\

      \ that Trump, who is famous for his short attention span and disdain for details,\
      \ would suddenly undertake a crash course in foreign policy would be about as\
      \ farfetched as me embracing a vegan lifestyle. But I do think you should perhaps\
      \ worry less about what is going to happen. It will be in the interests of both\
      \ men to declare the talks a success. But whatever policy changes are going\
      \ to come to North Korea and the region will be more about what happens between\
      \ Beijing, Moscow and Washington. Kim is absolutely beholden to his paymasters\

      \n\n\u201CI read with interest the recent Halftime report on the lack of amending\
      \ the Constitution since the 1970s. I think this has contributed to the increasing\
      \ partisanship and discord that is building in our country. When the people\
      \ fail to exercise the means to shape the supreme law of the land through amendments,\
      \ the political seats of power (Congress, Presidency) and judiciary become more\
      \ bitterly contested. I would hope more of my fellow citizens would get behind\
      \ grassroots movements to call for an Article V convention for constitutional\
      \ amendments that have bi-partisan support (balance budget, term limits). A\
      \ renewed push for constitutional amendments may be healthy for national discourse\
      \ and future as a country.\u201D \u2013 Andrew Couch, Salina, Kan.\n\n\n\n[Ed.\
      \ note: I agree with you on all counts, Mr. Couch. I was skeptical about the\
      \ push for a so-called convention of the states on the grounds that the document\
      \ we have is working pretty well. But, I don\u2019t know if I can say that with\
      \ the same confidence I once did. I do not blame our charter, but rather the\
      \ failure of our society to produce citizens in a large enough number who are\
      \ able to use it. There\u2019s no question that an Article V convention comes\
      \ with considerable risks. A second American republic is not guaranteed to bring\
      \ with it the virtues of the first. We know that the genius of our current republic\
      \ is that it protects things that are unpopular like free speech, freedom of\
      \ religion, freedom to keep and bear arms, etc. Things that are popular have\
      \ no need of protection, and I don\u2019t know that our new framers would be\
      \ of a mind to do unpopular things. But I certainly think that we are approaching\
      \ a point where a constitutional convention is needed.]\n\n\n\nShare your color\

      \ Robert Mueller was appointed far too early to investigate Russia\u2019s alleged\

      \ and House Intelligence Committees complete their report\u201D prior to Mueller's\

      \ an all-caps Twitter post.\n\nThe top Democrat on the committee, California\

    text: 'The White House is hitting back at former Veterans Affairs Secretary David
      Shulkin for claiming that he was fired from his job and that he was only informed
      about it shortly before President Donald Trump tweeted about his replacement.


      The Trump administration says he left his job willingly amid a bruising ethics
      scandal and mounting rebellion within the agency. The semantics of whether Shulkin
      resigned or was fired could be relevant to Trump''s ability to name an acting
      secretary to temporarily fill his place.


      On Sunday, chagrined by Shulkin''s public statements blaming his ouster on unfair
      "political forces" in the Trump administration, the White House circulated a
      "talking points" memo to some veterans groups in a bid to discredit him.


      Shulkin maintains that he never submitted a resignation letter.


      "I came to run the Department of Veterans Affairs because I''m committed to
      veterans," Shulkin said. "And I would not resign because I''m committed to making
      sure this job was seen through to the very end."


      HOWARD KURTZ: VA chief''s firing portrayed as chaotic, but Trump had some good
      reasons


      The semantics could be relevant to Trump''s ability to name an acting VA secretary
      to temporarily fill Shulkin''s place. Last week, Trump named Defense Department
      official Robert Wilkie to the acting position, bypassing Shulkin''s deputy secretary,
      Tom Bowman. Bowman has come under criticism for being too moderate to push Trump''s
      agenda.


      Under federal law, a president has wide authority to temporarily fill a federal
      agency job if someone "dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the
      functions and duties of the office." There is no mention of a president having
      that authority if the person is fired. Still, it''s unclear if courts would
      seek to draw a legal distinction between a firing and a forced resignation,
      if that is indeed what happened to Shulkin.


      Shulkin, a former hospital executive, fired back in a New York Times op-ed that
      called the atmosphere in Washington "toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive."
      He complained that he had "been falsely accused of things by people who wanted
      me out of the way ... It should not be this hard to serve your country."

      \ tape to The Washington Post in which Baker purportedly said: \u201CYou better\
      \ f-----g reply to me or I will f-----g kill you.\u201D\n\nEsty reportedly became\
      \ aware of the situation within a week but met with lawyers instead of firing\
      \ Baker. She acknowledged that she did not adequately protect Kain, has vowed\
      \ to \"do better\" and has apologized but says she would not resign.\n\nOn Saturday,\
      \ Connecticut Senate President Martin Looney was among at least six state Democrats\
      \ calling for Esty to resign, following such calls from Republicans and others.\n\
      \n\u201CCongresswoman Esty has long been a conscientious leader in the fight\
      \ against harassment and abuse in the workplace,\u201D Looney told the Connecticut\
      \ Post. \u201CHowever... if the facts of this matter involving former staff\
      \ of the congresswoman\u2019s office are as they are alleged to be in recent\
      \ news articles, then Congresswoman Esty should do the right thing and resign.\u201D\
      \n\nMae Flexer, a Democratic state senator, was among the first to call on Esty\
      \ to resign.\n\n\u201CIt was devastating to learn about the situation,\u201D\
      \ Flexer told the newspaper. \u201CThe congresswoman failed her staff on every\
      \ level when she decided to protect an alleged abuser instead of them. It\u2019\
      s completely unacceptable.\u201D\n\nThe others state Democrats asking Esty to\
      \ resign reportedly include state Sens. Cathy Osten and Paul Doyle; Susan Bysiewicz,\
      \ a Democratic candidate for governor; and Chris Mattei, a Democratic candidate\
      \ for state attorney general.\n\nEsty fired Baker in 2016, but gave him a $5,000\
      \ severance and a positive job recommendation.\n\n\u201CFirst and foremost,\
      \ let me say to this survivor that I am so sorry,\u201D Esty last week in a\
      \ statement. \u201CI am sorry that this incident in my office hurt (Kain), her\
      \ friends and family, and many of my present and former staffers.\u201D\n\n\
      Esty also reportedly repaid the $5,000 and said she demanded counseling for\
      \ Baker.\n\nAmong the Republicans quick to call for Esty\u2019s resignation\
      \ was Manny Santos, a former Republican mayor in Connecticut and Esty\u2019\
      s presumptive opponent in November\u2019s election.\n\n\u201CThere are two people\
      \ that share the blame in this tragedy: Tony Baker, the abuser, and Elizabeth\

    text: "President Trump has announced that a deal to protect hundreds of thousands\
      \ of young immigrants in the U.S. illegally was effectively dead.\n\nIn September,\
      \ the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the Deferred Action\
      \ for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) \u2013 which provides a level of amnesty\
      \ to certain illegal immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children \u2013\
      \ with a six-month delay for recipients.\n\nTrump set a deadline of March 5\
      \ as the end date for the DACA program, but a lower court ordered the administration\
      \ to continue to accept renewal applications indefinitely. The U.S. Supreme\
      \ Court declined in late February to take up the administration's request for\
      \ an appeal of the order that requires the continuing acceptance of renewal\
      \ applications.\n\n\u201CBorder Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do\
      \ their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like\
      \ Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. 'Caravans' coming. Republicans must\
      \ go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\u201D Trump\
      \ tweeted Sunday.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the DACA program and why the Trump\
      \ administration wants to dismantle it.\n\nWhat is the DACA program?\n\nThe\
      \ DACA program was formed through executive action by former President Barack\
      \ Obama in 2012 and allowed certain people who came to the U.S. illegally as\
      \ minors to be protected from immediate deportation. Recipients, called Dreamers,\
      \ were able to request \u201Cconsideration of deferred action\u201D for a period\
      \ of two years, which was subject to renewal.\n\n\u201CDeferred action is a\
      \ use of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual\
      \ for a certain period of time,\u201D U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\
      \ stated. \u201CDeferred action does not provide lawful status.\u201D\n\nIndividuals\
      \ were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June\
      \ 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and continuously lived in the\
      \ country since June 15, 2007.\n\nIndividuals also had to have a high school\
      \ diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or\
      \ still be in school. Recipients could not have a criminal record.\n\nIt did\
      \ not provide \u201Clegal status.\u201D\n\nHow many people are affected by DACA?\n\
      \nNearly 800,000 illegal-immigrant youth are under the program's umbrella.\n\
      \nThousands of people could lose their jobs if the DACA program is rescinded\
      \ permanently, according to a study by left-leaning think tank Center for American\
      \ Progress.\n\nDaniel Garza, president of the conservative immigration nonprofit\
      \ Libre Initiative, told Fox News that DACA offers a \u201Creprieve from a life\
      \ of uncertainty for innocent kids who didn\u2019t break the law.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
      It\u2019s rather disappointing to think they could return to a state of anxiety\
      \ and fear,\u201D he said.\n\nWhat did the Trump administration do?\n\nThe Trump\
      \ administration announced in September 2017 that it planned to phase out DACA\
      \ for current recipients, and no new requests would be granted. But a lower\
      \ court order requires the administration to continue accepting renewal applications\
      \ for those under the DACA program, and the Supreme Court rejected the Trump\
      \ administration's request to intervene.\n\nSince the announcement, Trump has\
      \ offered to work with lawmakers on a solution for the hundreds of thousands\
      \ of people in the U.S. who fell under DACA\u2019s umbrella of protections.\
      \ But at the same time, he repeatedly has blamed Democrats on social media for\
      \ lack of a solution.\n\n\"NO MORE DACA DEAL!\" Trump tweeted April 1.\n\nEarlier\
      \ this year, Trump released his \u201Cfour pillars\u201D of immigration reform,\
      \ which included a provision for legal status for DACA recipients and others\
      \ who would be eligible for DACA status. The White House estimated that total\
      \ to be 1.8 million people. The Senate rejected the plan.\n\nRepublicans \u2013\
      \ and some Democrats \u2013 opposed Obama\u2019s directive establishing DACA\
      \ from the start as a perceived overreach of executive power.\n\nObama spoke\
      \ out on social media after the Trump administration announced a plan to dismantle\
      \ the program, stating that it's \"self-defeating ... and it is cruel\" to end\
      \ DACA and questioned the motive behind the decision.\n\nDo any DACA recipients\
      \ serve in the military?\n\nDespite some rumors circulating online to the contrary,\
      \ Dreamers were eligible to serve in the U.S. military since 2014 when the Pentagon\
      \ adopted a policy to allow a certain amount of illegal immigrants to join.\n\
      \nIn fiscal year 2016, 359 DACA recipients had enlisted in the Army \u2013 which\
      \ is the only branch to accept immigrants of this category.\n\nA Department\
      \ of Defense official said in April that the military would continue to accept\
      \ noncitizen recruits, but it is unclear if that will continue to be the case.\n\

      \ likely lead\u201D to a special investigator, while fellow Republican and South\
      \ Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested the time is now for a special counsel\
      \ to lead such an investigation.\n\nIssa, a member and former chairman of the\
      \ House Oversight Committee, the chamber\u2019s top investigative panel, made\
      \ his comments to Fox News\u2019 \u201CSunday Morning Futures,\u201D after Attorney\
      \ General Jeff Sessions said last week he would not immediately appoint a new\
      \ special counsel to investigate Republican concerns involving the FBI and Justice\
      \ Department.\n\nSessions instead directed U.S. attorney John W. Huber, a senior\
      \ federal prosecutor from Utah, to evaluate \"certain issues\" including whether\
      \ a special counsel appointment was necessary.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019\
      s announcement Thursday came one day after the Justice Department's internal\
      \ watchdog said it would examine the Republican complaints of FBI misconduct\
      \ in the early stages of the Russia investigation, which has been led by special\
      \ counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThat watchdog investigation, led by Inspector General\
      \ Michael E. Horowitz, was requested by Sessions and congressional Republicans.\n\
      \nThey have been urging the inspector general\u2019s office to review whether\
      \ FBI and Justice Department officials abused their surveillance powers in using\
      \ information from the controversial anti-Trump dossier, compiled by a former\
      \ British spy and funded by Democrats, as part of the basis to justify monitoring\
      \ a former campaign adviser to President Trump.\n\nIssa said Sunday that second-guessing\
      \ Session\u2019s decision would be \u201Ceasy.\u201D However, he said getting\
      \ Huber and Horowitz involved gave such probes credibility and showed they were\
      \ \u201Clooking for truth.\u201D\n\nHe also expressed confidence that the inspector\
      \ general would inform the attorney general about anything that would need a\
      \ subpoena or be prosecuted.\n\n\u201CI have no doubt about it,\u201D said Issa,\
      \ who also urged Congress to give the inspector general the \u201Cbenefit of\
      \ the doubt\u201D on such matters.\n\nEarlier in the day, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham,\
      \ a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was more direct about his\
      \ desire for a special counsel.\n\n\u201CMy belief is it should be a special\
      \ counsel,\u201D he told \u201CFox News Sunday.\u201D \u201CI want a special\
      \ counsel with the same determination and resources to look at the abuses of\
      \ the FISA process, was the Clinton email investigation a sham, were there conflicts\
      \ of interest in the Justice Department?\u201D\n\nHe continued, \u201CI want\
      \ a special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the same determination\
      \ to look at those issues as 'is Mueller looking at the Trump campaign,' and\
      \ I don\u2019t see that yet.\u201D\n\nThe announcement of Horowitz's review\
      \ came weeks after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released\
      \ a declassified memo that detailed the use of political opposition research\
      \ to obtain a warrant to monitor Carter Page, the former adviser to Trump's\
      \ campaign.\n\nThe GOP memo described the department's use of information compiled\
      \ by Steele in obtaining a secret warrant to monitor Page's communications.\
      \ Steele's anti-Trump research was funded in part by Democrat Hillary Clinton's\
      \ campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs the Republicans suggested\
      \ the FBI may have conspired against Trump, Democrats countered with their own\
      \ memo that claimed the FBI only \u201Cmade narrow use\u201D of that research.\n\
      \nSessions referred the Republican complaints to the inspector general's office,\
      \ a move that enraged Trump, who denounced it as \u201Cdisgraceful\u201D and\
      \ said Sessions should have ordered his own investigation. Sessions insisted\
      \ he had taken the appropriate step.\n\nThe FBI already has been under intense\
      \ political pressure. Horowitz's office has been examining for more than year\
      \ the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation, an inquiry focused\
      \ not only on specific decisions made by FBI leadership but also on news media\
      \ leaks.\n\nThat investigation formed the basis of former Deputy Director Andrew\
      \ McCabe's firing. That inspector general's report has not been released but\
      \ is expected soon.\n\nSome Republicans praised Horowitz's latest move, including\
      \ Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has criticized the process\
      \ for obtaining secret surveillance warrants and had sought an inspector general\
      \ review.\n\nDemocrats have said the investigations have been a waste of money\
      \ and time.\n\nUnder pressure from lawmakers to move more quickly, FBI Director\
      \ Christopher Wray said last week he had assigned 54 FBI staff to collect documents\
      \ for separate congressional investigations into the Justice Department initiated\
      \ by the House Judiciary panel's Republicans. The staff, he said, have been\
      \ working from 8 a.m. to midnight.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this\

      \ catch and release, tweeted Sunday morning that Republicans need to take the\
      \ \"nuclear option\" when passing tougher immigration laws.\n\nThe president\
      \ had given Congress six months to pass legislation enshrining the Deferred\
      \ Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which protects about 800,000\
      \ young immigrants brought to country illegally as children from deportation.\n\
      \n\u201CBorder Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the\

      \nThe caravan the president was likely referring to was first reported by BuzzFeed\
      \ News on Friday. Organized by Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders,\
      \ the caravan traveled through Mexico without authorization last week, according\
      \ to the report. Officials in Mexico have not attempted to stop the migrants,\
      \ about 80 percent of them from Honduras. The group\u2019s intent is to provide\
      \ those people a safe way to travel to the U.S.\n\nNational Border Patrol Council\
      \ (NBPC) union chief Brandon Judd told \u201CFox & Friends\u201D on Sunday that\
      \ the migrants are riding on the benefit of catch and release, when illegal\
      \ immigrants are detained in the U.S. and released while they await for their\
      \ court hearings.\n\nTrump also threatened to pull out of the free trade agreement\
      \ with Mexico unless the country did more to stop the flow of illegal immigrants\
      \ entering the U.S. The U.S., Canada and Mexico are currently renegotiating\
      \ the North American Free Trade Agreement at Trump's insistence.\n\n\u201CMexico\
      \ is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into\
      \ Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at\
      \ our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or\
      \ I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!\u201D he tweeted.\n\n\u201C\
      These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want\
      \ in on the act!\u201D he added.\n\nTrump also spoke about DACA and Mexico before\

      \ Fla.\n\n\"Mexico has got to help us at the border,\" Trump told reporters\
      \ as he held his wife, Melania's, hand. \"If they're not going to help us at\
      \ the border, it's a very sad thing between our two countries.\"\n\nOrganizers\
      \ believe about two-thirds of the people in the caravan are planning to enter\
      \ the U.S. illegally or by asking for protection, according to BuzzFeed. The\
      \ caravan does not give the migrants the guarantee they will enter the U.S.\
      \ and uses any form of transportation necessary to make it to the border. Most\
      \ of the people are reportedly fleeing poverty and political unrest from their\
      \ home country.\n\n\u201CFirst off, you have got a Mexican government entity\
      \ that is assisting these individuals that are coming up to the United States,\u201D\
      \ Judd told \u201CFox & Friends.\u201D \u201CThese individuals do not have passports\

      \ not have the ability to stop the migrants at the border even if they only\
      \ step one foot on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201COnce they [the migrants] enter the country,\

      \ his and fellow Democrats' \u201Chysteria\u201D over President Trump adding\
      \ a \u201Ccitizenship\u201D question to the 2020 census, saying that getting\
      \ immigrants from oppressive Latin American countries to fill out the federal\
      \ questionnaire is \u201Cgoing to be difficult.\u201D\n\n\u201CImmigrants come\
      \ from countries with oppressive governments in many cases,\u201D Sherman said\
      \ on \u201CFox News Sunday.\u201D \u201CAnd to convince them that a man who\
      \ stands there and says these are rapists and murderers and must be pushed out\
      \ of our country (and that I) should get information about who\u2019s in your\
      \ family \u2026 is going to be difficult.\u201D\n\nSherman was almost certainly\
      \ referring to Trump vowing at the start of his presidential campaign to build\
      \ a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep drug dealers and rapists from\
      \ entering from Mexico.\n\nAnd last week, the Trump administration announced\
      \ that it would add the citizenship question to the upcoming federal census,\
      \ sparking concern among Democrats that immigrants will dodge the survey, which\
      \ will dilute political representation for states that tend to vote Democratic\
      \ and rob many communities of federal dollars.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TOWN STANDS\

      \ said on \u201CFox News Sunday,\u201D in response to Sherman\u2019s argument.\n\
      \nNelson also argued that the federal government is precluded from sharing such\
      \ information for 72 years after a person answers the census.\n\nCalifornia,\
      \ which has roughly 9.9 million immigrants, the most among states, is again\
      \ at the center of the debate on illegal immigration.\n\nAttorney General Jeff\
      \ Session in early March sued California over three state immigration laws --\
      \ including one related to so-called \u201Csanctuary cities\u201D that bars\
      \ local law enforcement officials in many cases from turning over prisoners\
      \ to immigration authorities.\n\nLast week, Orange County\u2019s all-Republican\
      \ voted to condemn the state law on police cooperation with federal immigration\
      \ authorities and to join the Trump administration lawsuit that seeks to overturn\
      \ it.\n\nMORE CALIFORNIA CITIES LOOKING TO REJECT STATE'S SANCTUARY LAW\n\n\u201C\
      We are put in an untenable position where our sheriff\u2019s deputies are precluded\

    text: "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a military hawk and solid President Trump\
      \ supporter, on Sunday gave the president a mixed review on recent foreign policy\
      \ decisions -- suggesting the president indeed brought North Korea to the negotiating\
      \ table, while disapproving of his plan to remove troops from Syria and allowing\
      \ Russia to run \u201Cwild.\u201D\n\n\u201CI think the problem that Russia is\
      \ running wild. Whatever we're doing, isn\u2019t working. The president for\
      \ some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly,\u201D Graham\
      \ told \u201CFox News Sunday,\u201D in the aftermath of Russia apparently poisoning\
      \ an ex-spy and his daughter in the United Kingdom and the release Friday of\
      \ a video from the Russian government apparently showing the successful launch\
      \ of an inter-continental ballistic missile.\n\nThe apparent assassination attempt\
      \ has resulted in Russian diplomats being expelled in the United States and\
      \ other countries, while Russia has countered by expelling foreign diplomats.\n\
      \nGraham, a former Air Force attorney and chairman of the Senate Armed Services\
      \ Committee, on Sunday praised Trump for imposing austere economic sanctions\
      \ on North Korea for leader Kim Jung Un\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear warhead\
      \ and inter-continental missile on which to launch it.\n\n'SATAN 2' NUCLEAR\
      \ MISSILE AGAIN TEST-LAUNCHED BY RUSSIA, AS PUTIN BRAGS OF 'INVULNERABLE' ARSENAL\n\
      \nGraham said the president\u2019s \u201Cmaximum pressure\u201D campaign has\
      \ paid off.\n\n\"The reason that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum\
      \ pressure campaign against North Korea launched by the Trump administration\
      \ where the world is beginning to follow has paid off,\" he said. \"They're\
      \ coming to the table because this hurts so much. Trump has called out Kim Jong-Un\
      \ by name for being the tyrant he is.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned about the outcomes\
      \ or promises in the emerging North Korea-South Korea talks and suggested the\
      \ meetings and a pending one between Trump and Kim is merely North Korea \u201C\
      buying time\u201D to complete its nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn response to Trump saying\
      \ on Friday that he\u2019ll get U.S. troops out of war-torn Syria \u201Cvery\
      \ soon,\u201D Graham said such a move would be \u201Cthe single worst decision\
      \ the president could make.\u201D\n\nThe once-power militant terror group the\
      \ Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has now been largely defeated and driven\
      \ out of Iraq and Afghanistan. In Syria, ISIS has been greatly reduced in territory,\
      \ now mostly only occupying some space in the western part of the country, according\
      \ to the BBC.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got ISIS on the run,\u201D Graham said Sunday."

    text: 'U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says chaos in the Trump administration is harming
      its ability to formulate coherent policy toward North Korea''s nuclear program
      and other important issues in Asia.


      Vacancies in the foreign service are undermining Washington''s ability to advance
      U.S interests, Warren told reporters in Beijing on Saturday.


      U.S. allies, while still supportive, are "searching for information" about U.S.
      intentions in Asia, the Massachusets Democrat said.


      "This has been a chaotic foreign policy in the region, and that makes it hard
      to keep the allies that we need to accomplish our objectives closely stitched-in,"
      Warren said.


      "This has been a chaotic foreign policy in the region, and that makes it hard
      to keep the allies that we need to accomplish our objectives closely stitched-in."
      - U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.


      Warren also visited South Korea and Japan during her trip to Asia.


      She said President Donald Trump''s agreement to meet with North Korean leader
      Kim Jong Un was "rash," in the absence of Pyongyang''s commitment to take "any
      steps at all to indicate that they were serious about denuclearization."


      On China, Warren said the U.S. needs to acknowledge Beijing''s growing power
      and influence and continue to emphasize the importance of human rights within
      the relationship.


      "I understand that our relationship with China is complex," Warren said. "There
      are areas where we have mutual interests and where we will work together to
      try to accomplish our shared goals. But there are also areas where we are vigorous
      competitors and do not have shared interests."


      Warren said the idea that China would more smoothly integrate with the rest
      of the world based on its economic growth and open markets "has been proven
      wrong."


      "And the United States is now trying to recalibrate that relationship," she
      said.


      China''s massive surveillance system, including its control over information
      on smartphones and the internet, has helped it to "close off" the country, she
      said.


      "We told ourselves a happy-faced story that never fit with the facts, and now
      ... the United States cannot avoid facing a very different reality with China,"
      Warren said.


      "We told ourselves a happy-faced story that never fit with the facts, and now
      ... the United States cannot avoid facing a very different reality with China."
      - U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.


      Warren''s visit to Northeast Asia follows the abrupt firing of Rex Tillerson
      as U.S. secretary of state and the Trump administration''s continued failure
      to fill many crucial positions.


      Tillerson lost the support of many of the State Department''s 75,000 workers
      over his moves to cut the budget, leave key leadership positions vacant and
      downplay human rights and democracy promotion as diplomatic priorities.


      Warren said "consistent efforts to take the legs out of our diplomatic corps"
      by understaffing the service stands to undermine America''s foreign policy efforts.


      "That''s someone whose information, whose thoughts, whose analysis doesn''t
      get put into the mix," she said.


      Warren said that there could be no military solution to the dispute with North
      Korea and that she has been told that "it will take strong economic and diplomatic
      efforts" to reduce the threat posed by Pyongyang.


      Warren didn''t disclose details of her discussions with Beijing officials, including
      key economic adviser Liu He, but said "the Chinese have not deviated from their
      talking points."'

    text: "Voter registration policies in Texas violate federal law, a U.S. District\
      \ Court judge ruled in an order unveiled Tuesday, marking another voting-rights\
      \ legal setback for the state's government.\n\nUnder the so-called \"Motor Voter\"\
      \ provisions of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, voters who apply for\
      \ or renew their driver's license must be provided an opportunity to register\
      \ to vote as well.\n\nBut Texans who went online to update their driver's license\
      \ information ran into roadblocks that in-person applicants did not, according\
      \ to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which brought the suit against Texas in\
      \ 2016.\n\nFor example, the plaintiffs alleged, users who clicked \u201CI want\
      \ to register to vote\" while updating their driver's license information were\
      \ directed to a form that they had to print and mail. They also received a notification\
      \ stating that clicking \"yes\" did not complete the voter registration process.\n\
      \nWATCH: TUCKER DISCUSSES REPORTED WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD IN TEXAS\n\nThat allegedly\
      \ confounded some plaintiffs and led to \"widespread confusion,\" according\
      \ to the lawsuit. The online process amounted to an illegal stumbling block,\
      \ given that the in-person process was smoother, the plaintiffs charged.\n\n\
      The plaintiffs specifically alleged that the unequal treatment of in-person\
      \ voters, as compared to online ones, violated both the Constitution's Equal\
      \ Protection Clause and federal law.\n\n\"For too long, the state of Texas has\
      \ ignored federal voting rights laws.\" - Texas Civil Rights Project director\
      \ Beth Stevens\n\n\u201CEverybody \u2013 all of our plaintiffs and many other\
      \ people we have spoken to \u2013 once they get their driver\u2019s license,\
      \ they assume that their voter registration information has been updated, too,\u201D\
      \ Texas Civil Rights Project President Mimi Marziani told NPR. \u201CAnd then\
      \ they show up at the polls thinking they are going to be able to cast a ballot\
      \ and they are not able to.\"\n\nTEXAS VOTER ID LAW RULED LEGAL -- FOR NOW\n\
      \nU.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia said a written opinion explaining the reasoning\
      \ behind his ruling will be released within 14 days.\n\nTexas does not currently\
      \ permit online voter registration, according to the Texas Tribune, and may\
      \ be forced to as a result of the ruling.\n\n\u201CFor too long, the state of\
      \ Texas has ignored federal voting rights laws intended to ensure that all eligible\
      \ voters have an opportunity to register to vote,\u201D Beth Stevens, voting\
      \ rights director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Texas Tribune.\
      \ \u201CWe look forward to seeing deep changes in [the Texas Department of Public\
      \ Safety\u2019s] voter registration practices in the coming months, affecting\
      \ well over a million Texans every year.\u201D\n\nThe ruling is the latest in\
      \ a string of voting-rights cases involving Texas. The state has spent years\
      \ fighting to preserve both its voter ID law -- which was among the strictest\
      \ in the U.S. -- and voting maps that were both passed by GOP-controlled Legislature\
      \ in 2011."

    text: 'The woman suspected of shooting three people at YouTube headquarters in
      San Bruno, Calif. before killing herself was furious with the company because
      it had stopped paying her for videos she posted on the platform, her father
      said late Tuesday.


      The police identified the shooter as Nasim Aghdam, 39, of Southern California
      -- and said they had a run-in with her earlier in the day.


      Ismail Aghdam said he reported his daughter missing on Monday after she did
      not answer her phone for two days. He said the family received a call from Mountain
      View police around 2 a.m. Tuesday saying they found Nasim sleeping in a car.


      He said he warned them she might be headed to YouTube because she "hated" the
      company.


      Mountain View Police spokeswoman Katie Nelson confirmed officers located a woman
      by the same name asleep in a vehicle asleep in a Mountain View parking lot Tuesday
      morning.


      Nelson said the woman declined to answer further questions but the police spokeswoman
      did not respond to a question about whether police were warned Aghdam might
      go to YouTube.


      Aghdam reportedly maintained a personal website alleging that YouTube compensated
      her unfairly and censored her views.


      Authorities said they are still probing Aghdam''s motive, and that there are
      no indications she knew the victims.


      In online postings last month, Aghdam alleged that YouTube tries to "censor
      and suppress people who speak the truth."


      "[YouTube] stopped everything and now she has no income." - Ismail Aghdam, father
      of shooting suspect Nasim Aghdam


      "BE AWARE!" warns a website that reportedly belonged to Aghdam. "Dictatorship
      exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal
      short term profits & do anything to reach their goals."


      The website contains several screenshots purportedly showing Aghdam''s YouTube
      user account page. The screenshots suggest that at least one of Aghdam''s YouTube
      accounts had been "de-monetized," meaning that she was not earning significant
      revenue from her uploads to the site.


      The company "de-monetizes" some channels for reasons including inappropriate
      material or having fewer than 1,000 subscribers.


      Text superimposed on one of the screenshots reads: "My Revenue for 300,000 Views
      Is $0.10?????"


      The website also espouses veganism, and includes videos apparently showing animals
      being skinned and cooked alive.


      Aghdam''s YouTube videos had been removed from the site by Tuesday evening for
      violating the company''s terms of service. Her personal website remained online.


      Ismail Aghdam, Nasim''s father, told NBC that YouTube "stopped everything and
      now she has no income."


      The shooting spree left terrified YouTube employees huddled inside, calling
      911, as officers and federal agents swarmed the company''s suburban campus sandwiched
      between two interstates just south of San Francisco.


      YouTube employee Dianna Arnspiger said she was on the building''s second floor
      when she heard gunshots, ran to a window and saw the shooter on a patio outside.


      She said the woman wore glasses and a scarf and was using a "big huge pistol."


      "It was a woman and she was firing her gun. And I just said, ''Shooter!,'' and
      everybody started running," Arnspiger said.


      She and others hid in a conference room for an hour while another employee repeatedly
      called 911 for updates.


      "It was terrifying," she said.

      \ statement that women who get an abortion should face the death penalty if\
      \ the procedure is ever criminalized in the state.\n\nBob Nonini, a three-term\
      \ state senator from Coeur d'Alene, first came under fire during a Monday candidate\
      \ forum in Moscow, Idaho, hosted by the conservative Christian podcast CrossPolitic.\n\
      \n\u201CThere should be no abortion and anyone who has an abortion should pay,\u201D\

      \ should be focused on the person performing the abortion rather than the woman.\n\
      \n\u201CLet me be clear \u2013 I have always been a pro-life supporter. That\
      \ means classifying abortion as murder. Since abortion is murder, I believe\
      \ we should consider penalties for individuals involved in these procedures,\u201D\

      \ harassment training.\n\n\u201CI made a comment that might have offended some\
      \ people and so I apologized to those sitting around me,\u201D he said in a\
      \ statement. The exact comment was not revealed.\n\nThe other Republican candidates\
      \ for lieutenant governor \u2013 Idaho Falls businesswoman Janice McGeachin\
      \ and former Idaho Republican Party Chairman Steve Yates \u2013 did not go as\
      \ far as Nonini on abortion during the Monday\u2019s forum.\n\n\u201CNo, I cannot\
      \ support a woman facing the death penalty for having an abortion,\u201D said\
      \ McGeachin. \u201CWhat we should do is prevent that.\u201D\n\nYates, meanwhile,\
      \ said that criminalizing abortion would not necessarily result in fewer women\
      \ getting the procedure.\n\n\u201CIn terms of criminalizing things, I have no\
      \ problem with that except that doesn\u2019t always solve the problem,\u201D\
      \ Yates said.\n\nAbortion in deep-red Idaho is a contentious issue, with many\
      \ Republican lawmakers and advocates trying to restrict the access to the procedure.\n\
      \nLast year, Abolish Abortion Idaho started a ballot initiative seeking to charge\

      \ he tries to make his campaign promise a reality.\n\nTrump said he discussed\
      \ bringing in reinforcements with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as he awaits\
      \ the completion of the structure, which is estimated to cost around $25 billion.\n\
      \n\"We're going to be doing things militarily,\" Trump said at a lunch with\
      \ Baltic leaders. \"Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're going\
      \ to be guarding our border with the military.\"\n\nTrump called the decision\
      \ to get the National Guard involved in helping monitor the border a \"big step.\"\
      \ However, the move wouldn't be completely unprecedented -- the U.S. National\
      \ Guard has deployed troops to the border in the past at the command of the\
      \ president.\n\nBoth Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have previously\
      \ called on the National Guard to assist with border patrol.\n\nObama sent about\
      \ 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010 to beef up efforts\
      \ to battle drug smuggling and illegal immigration. An administration official\
      \ described Obama's plan to Fox News in May 2010 as \"part of his comprehensive\
      \ plan to secure the southwest border.\"\n\nThe administration official said\
      \ Obama also requested $500 million for \"enhanced border protection and law\
      \ enforcement,\" responding to border state lawmakers calls for stronger security.\n\
      \nFour years prior, Bush deployed National Guard troops to the southern border,\
      \ despite promising in a speech earlier that year that the U.S. would not \"\
      militarize the southern border,\" calling Mexico \"our neighbor, and our friend.\"\
      \n\nUnder what later became a two-year operation known as \"Jump Start,\" 6,000\
      \ National Guard troops were sent to assist the border patrol with non-law enforcement\
      \ duties while additional border agents were hired and trained. Over those years,\
      \ about 29,000 National Guard forces participated, as forces rotated in and\
      \ out.\n\nTexas has also deployed military forces to its 800-mile border with\

      \ energy secretary, sent 1,000 Texas National Guardsmen to the Rio Grande Valley\

    text: "The Trump administration said Tuesday that it plans to slap 25-percent\
      \ tariffs on approximately 1,300 products from China in response to Beijing's\
      \ alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Trade\
      \ Representative's office, the mainly non-consumer products account for approximately\
      \ $50 billion in annual imports. The items include industrial chemicals, motorcycles\
      \ and medical devices.\n\nHowever, the proposed tariffs would not take effect\
      \ before a public comment period ends May 11.\n\nThe announcement comes 11 days\
      \ after Trump levied \"protective\" tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum in\
      \ response to what the administration has described as unfair trade practices.\n\
      \nIn response, China raised import duties on American pork, fruit, aluminum\
      \ and other products. China's government said earlier its imports of those goods\
      \ last year totaled $3 billion.\n\nThe latest sanctions are designed to punish\
      \ China for using strong-arm tactics in its drive to become a global technology\
      \ power, including pressuring American companies to share technology in exchange\
      \ for access to the Chinese market, forcing U.S. firms to license their technology\
      \ in China on unfavorable terms and even hacking into U.S. companies' computers\
      \ to steal trade secrets.\n\nThe administration sought to draw up the list in\
      \ a way that limits the impact of the tariffs -- a tax on imports -- on American\
      \ consumers while hitting Chinese imports that benefit from Beijing's sharp-elbowed\
      \ tech policies.\n\nAs part of its complaint, the U.S. is bringing a WTO case\
      \ against Chinese licensing policies that put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.\n\
      \nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised the announcement in a statement, saying:\
      \ \"Nothing will ever change when it comes to China\u2019s business practices\
      \ until somebody starts pushing back.\n\n\"It is not too much to ask for China\
      \ to stop stealing intellectual property and open up their markets that are\
      \ closed due to heavy-handed Chinese government barriers to foreign business\
      \ enterprises,\" Graham said.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it \"\
      strongly condemns\" the planned tariffs, which it said \"serves neither China's\
      \ interest, not the U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.\"\
      \n\n\"As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate,\" added\
      \ the embassy, which said Beijing would seek relief from the World Trade Organization\
      \ (WTO) and \"take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against\
      \ U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law.\"\n\nEven representatives of\
      \ the tech industry, which has complained for years that China has pilfered\
      \ U.S. technology and discriminated against U.S. companies, were critical of\
      \ the administration's latest action.\n\n\"Unilateral tariffs may do more harm\
      \ than good and do little to address the problems in China's (intellectual property)\
      \ and tech transfer policies,\" said John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China\
      \ Business Council.\n\nAnd the Internet Association, which represents such companies\
      \ such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, expressed concerns, too.\n\n\"There's\
      \ no doubt the U.S. government can and should address China's trade practices,\"\
      \ Melika Carroll, the association's senior vice president of global government\
      \ affairs. \"But consumers and American job creators should not be caught in\
      \ the crossfire. ... These tariffs will leave our customers worse off, stifle\
      \ growth and make it harder for the digital economy to succeed.\"\n\nThe National\
      \ Association of Manufacturers (NAM), said that the tariffs \"are likely to\
      \ create new challenges in the form of significant added costs for manufacturers\
      \ and American consumers [and] run the risk of provoking China to take further\
      \ destructive actions against American manufacturing workers.\"\n\n\"If the\
      \ imposition of tariffs is the first bid in negotiating a more level playing\
      \ field,\" NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement. \"... the\
      \ end product must be a new, strategic approach that includes negotiating a\
      \ fair, binding and enforceable rules-based trade agreement with China that\
      \ requires them to end their unfair trade practices once and for all.\"\n\n\
      In January, a federal court in Wisconsin convicted a Chinese manufacturer of\
      \ wind turbines, Sinovel Wind Group, of stealing trade secrets from the American\
      \ company AMSC and nearly putting it out of business. And in 2014, a Pennsylvania\
      \ grand jury indicted five officers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army\
      \ on charges of hacking into the computers of Westinghouse, US Steel and other\
      \ major American companies to steal information that would benefit their Chinese\
      \ competitors.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

    text: 'Special counsel Robert Mueller told President Trump''s attorneys last month
      that he does not consider Trump to be a criminal target in his investigation
      of Russian actions during the 2016 campaign, The Washington Post reported Tuesday
      night.


      The paper, citing "three people familiar with the discussions," reported that
      Mueller made the comments while negotiating with Trump''s attorneys about a
      potential interview with the president. The Post also reported -- citing "two
      people with knowledge of the conversations" -- that Mueller reiterated his need
      to interview Trump to determine whether the president intended to halt the Russia
      investigation while in office.


      According to the Post, Trump has "privately expressed relief" at Mueller''s
      description of his legal status, but some advisers have warned that the special
      counsel may be baiting the president into letting his guard down for any interview.


      Mueller also has said he needs to interview Trump in order to complete a report
      he will present to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing
      the investigation and who could decide to make Mueller''s report public.


      The report added that John Dowd resigned from Trump''s legal team last month
      after the president ignored Dowd''s advice to decline Mueller''s request for
      an interview.


      According to the Post, Trump''s other attorneys -- Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow --
      have told the president that refusing to sit down with Mueller would create
      an awkward situation since the president has repeatedly described the Russian
      investigation as a "witch hunt."

      \ stability and objectivity in our country.\u201D\n\nAsked by the moderator\
      \ about gun violence and school safety, he praised the push for stricter gun\

      \n\u201CHave you seen them on television the last couple of weeks? Have you\
      \ ever seen more articulate young people?\u201D Kasich said. \u201CAnd shame\
      \ on the adults who are attacking them.\u201D\n\nLast month the governor introduced\
      \ a six-point plan to reduce gun violence in Ohio.\n\n\u201CI can tell you in\
      \ my state, I\u2019m not going quietly on this,\u201D Kasich emphasized.\n\n\
      But he cautioned it was important that \u201Cwe don\u2019t want to denigrate\
      \ people who believe so firmly in the Second Amendment.\u201D\n\nEarlier he\
      \ met with Granite State advisers and supporters from his 2016 presidential\

      \ met with him today and I have to tell you I was really impressed.\u201D\n\n\
      Once a longshot for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, Kasich concentrated\
      \ his efforts on New Hampshire and came in second to Donald Trump in the Feb.\
      \ 2016 GOP primary. He kept his campaign alive deep into the primary calendar\
      \ and unlike Trump\u2019s other rivals for the nomination, Kasich never endorsed\
      \ Trump for president. And he\u2019s remained a critic of the President.\n\n\
      But Kasich said he took issue with that description.\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019\

      \ said he said he hasn't recognized his party anymore, adding, \u201Cthe Republican\
      \ Party of today is not the Republican Party that I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019\

      s a Republican now.\u201D\n\nKasich said he worried about the anger he\u2019\

      to make public the "suspicious activity report" filed in regard to a $130,000
      payment made to Daniels by President Trump''s personal attorney in October 2016.


      Michael Avenatti posted a link to the letter on his Twitter page Tuesday, one
      day after it was sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Avenatti has requested
      the report, known as a SAR, and any related information be made public no later
      than April 11.


      "[A]s Secretary of the Treasury, it is well within your authority to release
      the requested SAR information to allow the public to learn critical information
      relating to the payment," Avenatti wrote.


      Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claimed she had sex with Trump
      in 2006 -- the year after he married his current wife, Melania. She has sought
      to invalidate a non-disclosure agreement signed by her and by Trump''s attorney,
      Michael Cohen, and has offered to return the money she was paid in exchange
      for her silence.


      The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the bank used by Cohen to wire
      the $130,000 to Daniels flagged the transaction as suspicious. The report did
      not say when the bank reported the transaction to the government.


      Cohen has claimed that he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and was not reimbursed
      by the Trump campaign or the Trump Organization.


      In his letter to Mnuchin, Avenatti wrote, "If the payment was made as innocently
      as Mr. Cohen has suggested, there should be no objection to allowing the prompt
      release of the SAR."


      On the same day Avenatti sent the letter, Trump and Cohen filed papers in federal
      court in Los Angeles asking a judge to rule that Daniels'' case must be heard
      by an arbitrator instead of a jury.


      Trump''s attorneys have argued that Daniels could owe about $20 million for
      violating the non-disclosure deal.

      \ border with the military until a wall can be built, calling the move a \u201C\
      big step.\u201D\n\nTrump made the remarks during a meeting with Baltic leaders,\
      \ where he said he had discussed the matter with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\
      \ A White House official revealed later Tuesday to Fox News that the plan considered\
      \ by Trump would be a \u201Csubstantial\u201D mobilization of the National Guard.\n\
      \n\u201CUntil we can have a wall and proper security, we\u2019re going to be\
      \ guarding our border with the military,\u201D he said. \u201CThat's a big step,\
      \ we really haven\u2019t done that before, or certainly not very much before.\u201D\
      \n\nAt a news conference later, he confirmed the plan, saying the border is\
      \ unprotected by \u201Cour horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws.\u201D\n\n\
      \u201CWe don't have laws, we have catch-and-release,\u201D he said. \u201CYou\
      \ catch and then you immediately release and people come back years later for\
      \ a court case, except they virtually never come back.\u201D\n\nTrump did not\
      \ offer specifics, but the move appears to be at least partly motivated by a\
      \ caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border.\
      \ Buzzfeed, which first reported on the caravan, said that Mexican officials\
      \ had not yet attempted to stop the flow.\n\nIn Tuesday's discussion, Trump\
      \ and senior officials \u201Calso agreed on the need to pressure Congress to\
      \ urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking,\
      \ narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,\u201D White House Press Secretary\
      \ Sarah Sanders said. She added that Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten\
      \ Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph\
      \ Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present.\n\
      \nReports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a number of tweets\
      \ threatening to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to\
      \ cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants\
      \ originate.\n\n\n\n\u201CThe big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming\
      \ across Mexico and heading to our \u201CWeak Laws\u201D Border, had better\
      \ be stopped before it gets there,\u201D he tweeted Tuesday. \u201CCash cow\
      \ NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow\
      \ this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!\u201D\n\nAt the press conference he\
      \ said that NAFTA was an \u201Cembarrasing\u201D deal and that he had told Mexican\
      \ officials on Monday: \u201CI hope you're going to tell that caravan not to\
      \ get up to the border.\u201D He added that he thinks the caravan was being\
      \ broken up as a result.\n\nThe Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response\
      \ to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border. But according to\
      \ a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area where\
      \ the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Force\u2019s Barry Goldwater\
      \ live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona.\n\
      \nThe Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including\
      \ U.S. Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving\
      \ over 100 personnel from U.S. military\u2019s northern command -- including\
      \ eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama\
      \ authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border,\
      \ although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and whether they would\
      \ in fact be \u201Cboots on the ground.\"\n\n\n\nTrump has struggled to secure\
      \ funding for his central campaign promise of a wall, which the administration\
      \ and border officials say will cost approximately $20-25 billion. In the omnibus\
      \ bill signed by Trump last month, $1.6 billion was included for technology\
      \ and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the\
      \ prototypes Trump recently viewed in California.\n\n\n\nTrump briefly considered\
      \ vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also\
      \ the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood\
      \ Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought\
      \ to the country as children. He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon\
      \ to fund the wall.\n\nBrandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol\

    text: "The president has been criticized for continuing to retain ownership interest\
      \ in the Trump Organization, which opened the luxury Trump International Hotel\
      \ just blocks from the White House during the 2016 presidential campaign. It\
      \ has proven popular with administration staffers and foreign dignitaries alike.\n\
      \nThe Constitution bars public officeholders from accepting payments or titles\
      \ from foreign governments without approval from Congress, a clause designed\
      \ to prevent officials from being corrupted.\n\nIf it withstands likely appeals,\
      \ the suit could allow prosecutors \u2014 two Democratic attorneys general,\
      \ Maryland's Brian Frosh and D.C.'s Karl Racine \u2014 to seek documents from\
      \ the Trump Organization on how much money is sent there by states and foreign\
      \ governments, something that is not publicly known.\n\nFrosh and Racine argue\
      \ in the suit that the president's hotel and event spaces have an unfair advantage\
      \ over their own convention centers because of its ties to the president, a\
      \ harm the president's Department of Justice attorneys have said is speculative.\n\
      \nThe president said he'd turn control of his company over to his sons after\
      \ winning the presidency, but refused to divest from it. The Trump Organization\
      \ said it would donate all profits \"from foreign governments' patronage at\
      \ our hotels and similar businesses\" during Trump's presidency to the U.S.\
      \ Treasury, butthey've declined to detail the amount.\n\nThis is not the first\
      \ suit to target the president's business ties, and at least two have already\
      \ been dismissed in courts.\n\nIf this suit progresses, it is sure to bring\
      \ some history into the courtroom, since the plaintiffs are pointing to 230-year-old\
      \ decision as part of their legal argument. According to the opinion released\
      \ Wednesday, Maryland argued that the anti-corruption Emoluments Clauses in\
      \ the Constitution were key \"to its decision to enter the Union and that it\
      \ retains the power to enforce those provisions today.\""

    text: "Baker, who served as secretary of state for President George H.W. Bush,\
      \ as Treasury Secretary to President Ronald Reagan and Undersecretary of Commerce\
      \ to President Gerald Ford, also said he would have preferred to see the U.S.\
      \ work more closely with China ahead of Kim\u2019s recent visit there.\n\n\"\
      I think it's too bad that there wasn't some way that we could work with the\
      \ Chinese to achieve this, this result of denuclearization of the peninsula,\"\
      \ he said. \"China is the only country in the world that really has any influence,\
      \ significant influence on North Korea.\"\n\n\"We've seen the North Koreans\
      \ talk a lot but not do anything constructive by way of reducing their missiles\
      \ and development of nuclear weapons,\" he added, cautioning that a planned\
      \ meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump is unlikely to yield tangible\
      \ results.\n\nBaker also noted the risk of a military option should talks fail,\
      \ and said that he hopes the nations can find a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"If\
      \ you fail here, then you better be prepared to know what your next step is\
      \ going to be,\" Baker said. \"And everybody knows the cataclysmic consequences\
      \ of a war on the Korean Peninsula in terms of loss of life, primarily Korean\
      \ loss of life.\"\n\nStill, he said, China holds the key.\n\n\"I would have\
      \ sent some high-level envoy to Xi Jinping, the president of China, that the\
      \ Chinese trust and have confidence in. And I would have said, 'Look, you don't\
      \ like what's going on in the Korean Peninsula. We don't like what's going on.\
      \ Why don't we cooperate to stop it?'\" Baker told Mitchell.\n\n\u201CWe, the\
      \ United States, will support any government you install in North Korea, provided\
      \ they repudiate the acquisition or maintenance of nuclear weapons. We will\
      \ trade with that government, we will establish diplomatic relations, we will\
      \ execute a peace treaty ending the Korean War,\u201D he said, referring to\
      \ what he would have told China. \u201CYour job is to put a government in place\
      \ there that is different than this government.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re talking about\
      \ regime change,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\u201CYeah, that\u2019s what it would be,\u201D\
      \ Baker said, adding that at some point the question would come up if Kim doesn't\
      \ change his behavior.\n\nHis remarks come just after state-run media in both\
      \ China and North Korea reported that Kim had traveled to Beijing for talks\
      \ with the Chinese President Xi, in what is believed to have been the dictator\u2019\
      s first foreign trip since he took power in 2011. White House press secretary\
      \ Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed on Tuesday that the Chinese government had\
      \ contacted the White House to brief the administration on the visit.\n\nThat\
      \ visit comes after Trump agreed, earlier this month, to meet with Kim, after\
      \ the leader pledged to refrain from further nuclear tests and move toward denuclearization.\
      \ Previously, the two men had traded increasingly tense barbs for months over\
      \ North Korean missile tests and its nuclear program."

    text: "Even if Cohen is able to enforce the Daniels settlement agreement, the\
      \ most he can hope for is to force the case out of federal court and into arbitration.\
      \ He should not file suit for defamation; he will have an uphill battle if he\
      \ tries to recover liquidated damages of a million dollars-per-occurrence under\
      \ the Daniels\u2019 agreement.\n\nAnd calling Cohen a \"thug\"? No million-dollar\
      \ lawsuit will come of this. It's also not likely to warrant liquidated damages\
      \ under the contract, either.\n\nLiquidated damages provisions like the one\
      \ in Daniels' contract are only valid if:\n\n(1) the harm caused by the breach\
      \ is difficult to estimate; and (2) the set amount is a reasonable forecast\
      \ of compensation for the harm caused.\n\nWhile the harm caused by Daniels telling\
      \ her story is unknowable at this time, a million dollars for any statement\
      \ whatsoever does not sound like a reasonable forecast of anything. Even if\
      \ the liquidated damages clause is valid, the contract only allows \"DD\" to\
      \ pursue liquidated damages. \"DD\" is alleged to be the pseudonym for Donald\
      \ Trump in the contract. Cohen cannot pursue liquidated damages under the contract,\
      \ nor can a company he set up, EC Consultants.\n\nCalling Cohen a \"thug\" does\
      \ not violate the Daniels' agreement, and it doesn't trigger the liquidated\
      \ damages clause, which a court might.\n\nMoreover, under the contract, only\
      \ an arbitrator can award liquidated damages, not a court, which means Cohen\
      \ would have to compel arbitration, under a contract that doesn't appear to\
      \ permit Cohen to seek arbitration.\n\nThen again, at least one arbitrator has\
      \ already been convinced by the Cohen/Trump team to hear this case, at least\
      \ long enough to issue a restraining order against Daniels. That presumably\
      \ means the arbitrator was convinced that Cohen or EC Consultants could enforce\
      \ an arbitration provision which was only enforceable by \"DD,\" in his stead.\n\
      \nCould Cohen sue Daniels independently for defamation, based upon her lawyer's\
      \ insults on television?\n\nAs a general rule, a client can be vicariously liable\
      \ for her attorney's defamatory statements, but only if the client authorized\
      \ or ratified them. Avenatti\u2019s words were improvisational responses to\
      \ Schwartz\u2019s barbs; Daniels had nothing to do with them.\n\nIt makes no\
      \ difference though. Cohen won't be suing Daniels or Avenatti, especially not\
      \ for being called a thug by Avenatti.\n\nCohen does not want to be in any court,\
      \ as a defendant or as a plaintiff. Trump and Cohen are learning quickly that\
      \ it's much easier to use litigation as a business practice when you are only\
      \ a business and not the president of the United States.\n\nTrump denies any\
      \ alleged affair with Daniels, according to his lawyer and the White House.\n\
      \nLike Trump, Cohen does not want to be dragged into the discovery process,\
      \ either. The scope of questioning in a deposition is too broad and too risky.\
      \ Neither Trump nor Cohen should willingly subject themselves to testimony under\
      \ oath right now if they can avoid it. That's why they are so eager to get cases\
      \ into arbitration whenever possible.\n\nThey may succeed in forcing some of\
      \ these contract cases into arbitration. That doesn't mean they will have their\
      \ liquidated damages clauses upheld. They cannot force any of the defamation\
      \ cases into arbitration. Those will remain in court, as will the defendants.\n\

      and his deputy, Rick Gates, were in touch with a Manafort associate who had
      an ongoing relationship with Russian intelligence, according to court documents
      filed late Tuesday by prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.


      The filings also allege that Gates stated he was aware the Manafort associate
      had once been an officer with Russian military intelligence (GRU). The Manafort
      associate is not named, but is referred to as "Person A" and described as someone
      who the FBI says "has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties
      in 2016."


      Gates pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and making false statements and
      is cooperating with Mueller''s investigation of possible collusion between the
      Trump campaign and Russia.


      Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges that include bank fraud and money
      laundering in connection with his work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.


      Gates had also worked with Manafort in Ukraine.


      The Mueller team provided the FBI''s evaluation of the Manafort associate in
      a pre-sentencing report for another defendant who has pleaded guilty in the
      probe, London-based attorney Alex van der Zwaan. Prosecutors said van der Zwaan
      lied about his contact with Gates, and with Gates''s contact with Person A during
      the 2016 presidential campaign.


      While working for the London office of the Skadden Arps law firm, Van der Zwaan
      had helped compile a 2012 report commissioned by Manafort to defend the prosecution
      of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Manafort worked as a consultant
      for the government of Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych, which had imprisoned
      Tymoshenko.


      During his first interview with the special counsel''s office in 2017, according
      to the report, "van der Zwaan admitted that he knew" Person A was connected
      to Russian intelligence, "stating that Gates told him Person A was a former
      Russian intelligence officer with the GRU."


      But prosecutors say van der Zwaan, who is married to the daughter of a Russian
      billionaire, "lied repeatedly" to Mueller''s prosecutors and "destroyed and
      failed to produce pertinent documents."


      According to prosecutors, van der Zwaan, Gates and Person A had a series of
      conversations in September and October 2016, including a phone call that van
      der Zwaan recorded. Prosecutors say Van der Zwaan concealed the recorded phone
      call from them.'

      \ \u2014 One of the biggest stories of this midterm cycle is the record number\
      \ of women \u2014 particularly Democratic women \u2014 who are running for political\
      \ office.\n\nSo, how are they faring so far? After two primaries this month\
      \ \u2014 in Illinois and in Texas (which holds primary runoffs if no candidate\
      \ gets to at least 50 percent) \u2014 out of a total of 67 female House candidates,\
      \ 35 either won their primaries outright or will compete in a runoff on May\
      \ 22, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. That\u2019s about\
      \ half.\n\nThe win rate is higher for Democrats, who have more female candidates\
      \ running for the House overall but also saw greater success rates; 31 of 54\
      \ Democratic women in the two states either won or advanced, compared to just\
      \ four of 13 Republican female House candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of\
      \ some of the highlights from female candidates in Illinois and Texas.\n\nIllinois\n\
      \nWomen will appear on the general election ballot in two of Illinois\u2019\
      s closely watched congressional races in the fall. Lauren Underwood handily\
      \ won the Democratic primary to run against Randy Hultgren, while Betsy Dirksen\
      \ Londrigan will face off against Republican Rodney Davis. Both are seats where\
      \ Republicans are favored but that Democrats have a shot to turn blue.\n\nBut\
      \ one of the state\u2019s most vulnerable Republicans, Peter Roskam, will face\
      \ another man in the general election after scientist Sean Casten narrowly won\
      \ the primary against Emily\u2019s List favorite Kelly Mazeski.\n\nNo Republican\
      \ women were on the primary ballot for an Illinois House seat, although GOP\
      \ gubernatorial challenger Jeanne Ives lost a closer-than-expected contest against\
      \ incumbent Bruce Rauner.\n\nTexas\n\nTwo female candidates made the runoff\
      \ in the state\u2019s most contentious Democratic race \u2014Lizzie Pannill\
      \ Fletcher and Laura Moser, whose past comments about a town in Texas led the\
      \ DCCC to publicly oppose her bid. The winner of that contest on May 22 will\
      \ face Republican John Culberson in what could be Democrats\u2019 best shot\
      \ at a House pickup in the state.\n\nDemocratic women also made the runoffs\
      \ to compete against vulnerable Republicans Will Hurd and Pete Sessions.\n\n\
      Dem gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez, who would face a longshot general election\
      \ bid against incumbent Greg Abbott, is also headed to a May runoff.\n\nAnd\
      \ with their primary wins in two open Democratic seats, the state is poised\
      \ to send its first two Latinas \u2014Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia \u2014\
      \ to Congress.\n\nOn the Republican side, female candidates made the runoffs\
      \ in crowded primaries in a solid red district (to replace retiring Rep. Jeb\
      \ Hensarling) and a solid blue one (to replace retiring Rep. Gene Green), but\
      \ fell short in the GOP\u2019s most crowded and contentious primary in TX-21.\n\
      \nSupreme Court to take a new look at partisan gerrymandering\n\nFrom NBC\u2019\
      s Pete Williams: \u201CFor the second time this term, the U.S. Supreme Court\
      \ considers a question that could change the nature of American politics: Is\
      \ it unconstitutional for states to draw the boundary lines for voting districts\
      \ in a blatantly partisan manner? On Wednesday, the justices take up a challenge\
      \ brought by Republicans in Maryland who say Democrats intentionally carved\
      \ up a congressional district to get an electoral edge. A critical issue, as\
      \ was also central for a case heard last fall challenging partisan gerrymandering\
      \ in Wisconsin, is how much partisanship is too much in a process that has always\
      \ been manipulated by political parties in the majority.\u201D\n\nBy taking\
      \ up the pair of cases (one, by the way, in which gerrymandering benefitted\
      \ Republicans and one in which it benefitted Democrats), the court has seemed\
      \ to signal that it\u2019s finally ready to weigh in on an issue they\u2019\
      ve previously stayed away from \u2014 and one with huge potential consequences\
      \ for American politics. The justice to watch in today\u2019s oral arguments,\
      \ by the way? Anthony Kennedy, who gave the deciding vote in 2004 that kept\
      \ the court out of partisan gerrymandering for the time being, even while saying\
      \ he was open to revisiting the issue.\n\nFor David Shulkin, no confidence but\
      \ also no \u201Cyou\u2019re fired\u201D \u2014 yet\n\nPlenty of folks have noted\
      \ that, for a former reality star whose catchphrase was \u201Cyou\u2019re fired,\u201D\
      \ President Trump has been notably averse to announcing personnel changes quickly\
      \ and decisively. VA chief David Shulkin, who has been subject to rumors of\
      \ his dismissal for weeks but has not yet been fired, is the latest example.\
      \ After his ouster seemed imminent at the beginning of the week, Shulkin is\
      \ still on the job even as the White House has \u2014 at best \u2014 sent mixed\
      \ messages about his future.\n\nPart of the reason for the delay, by the way,\
      \ is that there isn\u2019t a clear replacement for Shulkin, and the pick could\
      \ face a difficult confirmation hearing. But Trump\u2019s habit of leaving members\
      \ of his own team twisting in the wind for days, weeks or even months on end\
      \ (see: Tillerson, Rex), also means that the sprawling government agencies that\
      \ they lead are also left in limbo, wondering at any given moment who \u2014\
      \ if anyone \u2014 is in charge."

      \ (Seattle) in Washington state \u2014 will still stop receiving grant funding\
      \ from the program as of June 30. However, the government\u2019s filing temporarily\

      \ a significant walk-back from the administration\u2019s original 2017 decision\
      \ to cancel the program, which many medical professionals credit with helping\
      \ to drive the nation\u2019s teen pregnancy rate to an all-time low.\n\nIt means\
      \ the program\u2019s funding will be protected in the budget during litigation\
      \ instead of being redistributed to other unrelated government programs. The\
      \ grantees receive a total of $3.47 million annually in funding.\n\nBased on\
      \ the internal emails and notes, NBC News reported that the program\u2019s abrupt\
      \ cancellation in July of 2017 was directed by Trump political appointees over\
      \ the objections of career experts at HHS.\n\nLater that week, in talks with\
      \ lawyers representing one of the grantees, the government agreed to preserve\
      \ some of the funding.\n\nIn the agency\u2019s internal notes revealed last\
      \ week, Evelyn Kappeler, who for eight years has led the Office of Adolescent\
      \ Health, which administers the program, repeatedly expressed concerns about\
      \ terminating the program, but appeared out of the decision-making loop and\
      \ at one point was driven to tears.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed the newly obtained\
      \ emails show that HHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act that bars arbitrary\
      \ decision-making and that the political appointees thwarted the will of Congress.\n\
      \nRepresentatives of Democracy Forward say they will also file a motion on Thursday\
      \ asking that the money continue to flow as long as the case is pending.\n\n\
      Political leadership at HHS contended the program is ineffective and had previously\
      \ shared with NBC a fact sheet stating that 73 percent of the projects funded\
      \ by the program \u201Chad no impact or had a negative impact on teen behavior,\
      \ with some teens more likely to begin having sex, to engage in unprotected\
      \ sex or to become pregnant\u201D \u2014 an argument that conflicts with the\
      \ program\u2019s proven success rate.\n\nThe notes and emails showed that three\
      \ appointees with strict pro-abstinence beliefs \u2014 including Valerie Huber,\
      \ the then-chief of staff for the department's Office of the Assistant Secretary\
      \ for Health \u2014 guided the process to end the program.\n\nThe program has\
      \ had bipartisan support in Congress and trained more than 7,000 health professionals\
      \ and supported 3,000 community-based organizations since its inception in 2010.\n\
      \nHaywood L. Brown, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\
      \ has called the program \u201Cvital.\u201D The administration\u2019s earlier\

      \ that have nothing to do with the House or who controls it.\n\nOn Tuesday,\
      \ Vice President Mike Pence invoked the minority leader at length during a private\
      \ fundraiser for North Dakota Senate candidate Kevin Cramer, a Republican congressman\
      \ who is running against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D. The state does not have\
      \ a competitive House race.\n\n\"The Democrats want to take us back in another\
      \ direction. Nancy Pelosi \u2014 I was there the last time she was speaker.\
      \ I'm telling you, you don\u2019t want to see that happen again,\" Pence said,\
      \ according to a person in the room.\n\n\"That was when they got Obamacare,\"\
      \ continued Pence, who served in Congress from 2001 to 2013. \"They thought\
      \ you grow an American economy by raising taxes and expanding regulation. They\
      \ want to bring it all back.\"\n\nIn the battle for the House, Republicans have\
      \ made it clear they plan \"put Nancy Pelosi on trial and prosecute the case,\"\
      \ as the leader of one major GOP super PAC told NBC News.\n\nSo some Democrats\
      \ are ducking out of the courtroom.\n\nIn Pelosi's home state of California,\
      \ arguably the central battleground for the House this year, a survey of 34\
      \ Democratic candidates by The Mercury News found only two willing to publicly\
      \ commit to voting for Pelosi to be their leader if they make it to Congress\
      \ next year.\n\nThe goal of the Republican attacks on Pelosi is both to mobilize\
      \ the GOP base as well as to try to convince swing voters that the Democratic\
      \ candidate, no matter how much they profess independence, will ultimately empower\
      \ the San Francisco liberal who leads her party in the House.\n\nJanz decided\
      \ to pre-emptively speak out on Pelosi, as did Democrat Paul Davis, who pledged\
      \ to oppose her the day he launched his campaign in Kansas last August, calling\
      \ for \"new leadership in both political parties.\"\n\nWhile congressional leaders\
      \ are often unpopular with the public, Republicans note her approval ratings\
      \ are particularly weak, pointing to toxic numbers among independents and relatively\
      \ tepid support even from Democrats.\n\nLamb won his special House election\
      \ by just 627 votes, and Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University\
      \ Polling Institute, said his disavowal of Pelosi could have been the decisive\
      \ factor.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that he got at least 800 votes out\
      \ of that district specifically from conservative-minded independents that were\
      \ assured he was not going to support Pelosi,\" Murray said.\n\nThat ditch-Pelosi-strategy\
      \ makes sense in a deep red district like Lamb's or Nunes', which President\
      \ Donald Trump won by 10 percentage points in 2016. But Murray cautioned breaking\
      \ from the national party may not be a good idea in a district where getting\
      \ Democrats to turn out is more important than converting moderates.\n\nRepublicans\
      \ still tried to tie Lamb to Pelosi, as they have in almost every competitive\
      \ congressional race since Trump's election.\n\n\"Pelosi knows Conor Lamb will\
      \ follow her liberal heard,\" said the narrator of one ad from the National\
      \ Republican Congressional Committee. \"Backed by Nancy Pelosi, Lamb will be\
      \ a vote for her liberal agenda of higher taxes, more job-killing regulation,\
      \ and a weaker military. Conor Lamb, he's with her, not us.\"\n\nThat line of\
      \ attack proved more effective in Georgia's special election last year. Democrat\
      \ Jon Ossoff lived outside the district, had a relatively thin resume, and declined\
      \ to cast aside Pelosi, making himself susceptible to GOP admakers trying to\
      \ present him as an out-of-touchy lefty.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Pelosi\
      \ critic who canvassed for Lamb, said the issue was on voters' mind in the Western\
      \ Pennsylvania district. And hoped other Democrats would take note.\n\n\"We\
      \ heard this from several people whose houses we visited,\" Moulton said. \"\
      The people want change not just with the Congress getting rid of Republicans,\
      \ they want change in the Democratic Party as well.\"\n\nPelosi herself has\
      \ not yet asked any Democratic candidates for their support, a Pelosi aide told\
      \ NBC News, suggesting that retaking the House overrides any other concerns\
      \ for her even as some senior members of her caucus have called on her and other\
      \ party leaders to step aside.\n\nPelosi is a prodigious fundraiser and proven\
      \ tactician, as her allies are quick to note. And she's never lost an internal\
      \ party vote, despite a career in leadership that has spanned decades of ups\
      \ and downs for her party."

      \ North Dakota race is particularly high on Trump's priority list because Cramer\
      \ was one of his earliest political supporters and has been one of his most\
      \ loyal allies on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"We've got competitive Senate races all\
      \ over the country, but I lost count of the number of times the president said\
      \ to me, 'What about Kevin Cramer? Have you talked to Kevin Cramer lately?'\"\

      \ that's why North Dakotans can expect to see Trump in their state soon. \"\

    text: 'But because partisanship is always a factor when political boundaries are
      redrawn by the party in the majority, a central issue in this case is how to
      know when it goes too far.


      "However much you think is too much, this case is too much," said Justice Elena
      Kagan. "How much more evidence of partisan intent could we need?"


      A Republican, Roscoe Bartlett, held the seat for 20 years and won by a 28 percent
      margin in 2010. After the redistricting, he lost by a 21 percent margin.


      Michael Kimberly, a lawyer representing the Republican challengers, told the
      court that the blatantly partisan gerrymandering violated the First Amendment.


      The new 6th District boundaries, he said, retaliated against Republicans who
      had supported Bartlett in past elections. "Government officials cannot single
      out citizens based on their political views."


      But the court appeared concerned that a ruling for the Republicans in this case,
      with obviously partisan intent, would open the door to challenges when political
      considerations were not as blatant.


      "The problem," said Justice Stephen Breyer, "is that we will never have such
      a clear record again. So what are we to do?" He asked if there could be a "practical
      test that won''t get judges involved in every redistricting."


      The First Amendment test advanced by the Republican challengers in Maryland
      seemed too vague for Justice Samuel Alito, who asked, "How could any legislature
      ever be able to redistrict, if it picks a plan that favors any party?"


      Steven Sullivan, Maryland''s solicitor general, said the state did not simply
      consider partisan advantage in drawing the new 6th District boundaries.


      Among other factors, he said, was eliminating a crossing of the Chesapeake Bay.


      The court pondered a similar question last fall when it heard a partisan gerrymandering
      case from Wisconsin involving new boundaries for the entire state''s legislative
      districts.


      Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., right, campaigns for his seat in 2012. Bill O''Leary
      / The Washington Post/Getty Images file


      Based on the questions and comments from the justices during Wednesday''s argument,
      the court apparently has not come up with a satisfactory resolution of that
      case, either. Though it was argued in October, the court was likely holding
      it until it heard the Maryland case.


      At one point on Wednesday, Justice Breyer suggested that the court could combine
      the Wisconsin and Maryland cases with another from North Carolina and take up
      the issue next year, with lawyers for each side allowed to advance and criticize
      possible ways to develop a test for excessive partisanship.


      It''s unlikely Breyer would have offered such a suggestion if the court had
      already come up with a satisfactory way to decide the Wisconsin case.


      Until recently, federal courts rejected claims of excess partisanship in gerrymandering,
      concluding that such disputes were inherently political, not legal.


      But last year, a panel of three federal judges struck down state house district
      maps drawn in 2011 by Wisconsin''s Republican controlled legislature, finding
      the results were so blatantly partisan that they denied Democrats a fair shot
      at electing candidates of their choosing. That ruling was the subject of the
      U.S. Supreme Court''s first case this term involving partisan gerrymandering.


      And in January, Pennsylvania''s supreme court ruled that congressional district
      boundaries in the state were so obviously drawn to disfavor Democrats that they
      "clearly, plainly, and palpably" violated the Pennsylvania constitution.'

      \ transactions had nothing to do with any of his meetings in the White House.\"\

      \ \u2014 The 2018 midterm season has officially been underway for three weeks,\
      \ with primary contests in Texas and Illinois yielding plenty of intraparty\
      \ drama already this month (and there\u2019s more Texas intrigue to come, with\
      \ contested runoffs on May 22).\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a very interesting\
      \ spring and summer as both parties fight amongst themselves to choose the candidates\
      \ who will appear on the ballot in November. Here are ten of the most compelling,\
      \ contentious or consequential primaries to watch before we head into the fall\
      \ \u2014 from earliest to latest.\n\n1. WV-SEN, GOP primary (May 8) \u2014 Republicans\
      \ are increasingly worried that former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who\
      \ served a year in prison after the 2010 explosion at his West Virginia mine\
      \ \u2014 could come out on top in the primary. If he does, many fear that vulnerable\
      \ Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin would have a far easier path to reelection in\
      \ the fall than if he faced either of Blankenship\u2019s main opponents, Rep.\
      \ Evan Jenkins or state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.\n\n2. IN-SEN, GOP\
      \ primary (May 8) \u2014 Incumbent Joe Donnelly is one of the most vulnerable\
      \ Democrats in the country, but the three main GOP contenders to take him on\
      \ \u2014Todd Rokita and Luke Messer and Mike Braun \u2014 must first get through\
      \ a brutal and deeply personal brawl to win the nod.\n\n3. OH-GOV, Dem and GOP\
      \ primary (May 8) \u2014 Former federal consumer watchdog Richard Cordray and\
      \ longtime Ohio pol Dennis Kucinich are the top candidates fighting for the\
      \ Democratic nomination. Attorney General Mike DeWine is the heavy favorite\
      \ against Lt. Gov Mary Taylor on the GOP side, but it\u2019s been a nasty race,\
      \ with a pro-Taylor super PAC deriding DeWine on TV as insufficiently close\
      \ to Trump and DeWine branding his opponent as a \u201Cslacker.\u201D\n\n4.\
      \ GA GOV, Dem primary (May 22) \u2014 Candidates Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans\
      \ are locked in a tense contest as the two female Democrats try to claim the\
      \ party\u2019s mantle, with race playing a prominent role (Abrams is black,\
      \ Evans is white.)\n\n5. California House primaries (June 5) \u2014 Orange County\u2019\
      s changing demographics and Clinton-friendly districts should be favorable to\
      \ Democrats, particularly after a pair of high-profile Republican retirements.\
      \ But the state\u2019s top-two primary system threatens to shut Democrats out\
      \ of several contests completely if too many Democratic candidates divide the\
      \ vote amongst themselves.\n\n6. VA-SEN, GOP primary (June 12) \u2014 Virginia\
      \ Democrat Tim Kaine is expected to have a fairly smooth reelection race, but\
      \ the outcome of the GOP primary still may have important consequences for the\
      \ Republican Party up and down the ballot in Virginia. The best-known GOP contender\
      \ so far is Corey Stewart, who stridently defended Confederate imagery during\
      \ his near-win in the gubernatorial primary last year. Republicans privately\
      \ worry that Stewart at the top of the ticket could drag down moderate Republican\
      \ House candidates elsewhere in the state, hurting the party\u2019s chances\
      \ of keeping the House majority.\n\n7. WI-SEN, GOP primary (August 14) \u2014\
      \ There\u2019s a ton of outside money already pouring into Wisconsin as state\
      \ Sen. Leah Vukmir (who\u2019s been endorsed by Scott Walker\u2019s wife Tonette)\
      \ and Marine veteran Kevin Nicholson (who has the backing of the Club for Growth\
      \ and megadonor Richard Uihlein, among others) battle for the chance to take\
      \ on vulnerable Democrat Tammy Baldwin.\n\n8. AZ-SEN, GOP primary (August 28)\
      \ \u2014 Conservative Kelli Ward has been bashing Rep. Martha McSally from the\
      \ right (and don\u2019t forget that Joe Arpaio is in this race, too). The winner\
      \ will face a strong candidate in Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\n\n9. FL-GOV, Dem\
      \ and GOP primary (August 28) \u2014 Guns are becoming a big issue on both sides\
      \ of this primary as Gwen Graham (daughter to former senator and governor Bob\
      \ Graham) dukes it out with Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former Miami\
      \ Beach Mayor Phil Levine in the Democratic contest, while the competitive Republican\
      \ field includes agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam, Trump-backed Rep. Ron\
      \ DeSantis and \u2013 likely \u2013 Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran.\n\
      \n10. NY-GOV, Dem primary (September 13) \u2014 Actress and activist Cynthia\
      \ Nixon, famous for her role as a star in the HBO hit series \u201CSex and the\
      \ City,\u201D could give incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo a tough fight if she can\
      \ build the right coalition of voters in the state.\n\nThe stakes are huge in\
      \ the battle over a Census question on citizenship\n\nLast night, the Commerce\
      \ Department announced the addition of a question on the 2020 Census that would\
      \ ask respondents about their citizenship status. The state of California almost\
      \ immediately announced that it will sue the Trump administration over the decision,\
      \ calling it unconstitutional; Eric Holder\u2019s National Democratic Redistricting\
      \ Committee is also vowing to fight it in court.\n\nHere\u2019s why this debate\
      \ is such a big deal: Opponents of the citizenship question have long worried\
      \ that its inclusion \u2014 on top of the Trump administration\u2019s already\
      \ hard-line rhetoric on immigration \u2014 would scare non-citizens away from\
      \ participating, resulting in a major undercount in areas with high immigrant\
      \ populations. The starkest example might be in California, where advocates\
      \ think an undercount would likely cost them at least one House seat after congressional\
      \ seats are reapportioned based on the new Census counts.\n\nBut an undercount\
      \ of immigrants could have sweeping nationwide effects too, particularly because\
      \ both congressional representation and the distribution of federal funding\
      \ are derived from Census data. That means that a shift in the count could move\
      \ political power and federal resources away from more diverse cities and towards\
      \ more rural, GOP-leaning areas instead.\n\nThe Stormy storm rages on\n\nYesterday,\
      \ we wrote that a quote from retiring Rep. Ryan Costello caught our eye when\
      \ he complained that the constant stream of distractions from the White House\
      \ \u2014 including the Stormy Daniels story \u2014 is making it far harder for\
      \ endangered Republicans to break through and tout their own accomplishments.\
      \ (Costello was even more direct in a New York Times interview published last\
      \ night, saying \u201CIf I had a town hall this week, it would be question after\
      \ question. Do you believe him or do you believe her? Why don\u2019t you believe\
      \ her?\u201D)\n\nAnd just a quick look at all of the headlines about Daniels\
      \ yesterday illustrates how the sheer volume of news on the scandal is crowding\
      \ out positive messages that GOP candidates might be trying to share.\n\nHere\u2019\
      s a look at the developments in the Stormy Daniels story in the last 24 hours:\n\
      \nDaniels filed an amended lawsuit alleging that Michael Cohen defamed her and\
      \ violated campaign finance law.\n\nHer lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said that\
      \ Cohen tried to keep him off the case.\n\nThe White House weighed in, saying\
      \ that Trump \u201Cdoes not\u201D believe that Daniels was threatened over her\
      \ affair allegations and that \u201Cthere is nothing to corroborate her claim.\u201D\
      \n\nAvenatti said that he has \u201Ca handful of leads\u201D on who threatened\
      \ Daniels.\n\nA friend of Daniels said that she still has the dress from the\
      \ night of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post reported\
      \ that Trump has privately called the scandal a hoax and complained that \u201C\
      Daniels is not the type of woman he finds attractive.\u201D\n\nWaiting for an\
      \ FEC investigation of Cohen\u2019s payment to Daniels? Don\u2019t hold your\
      \ breath.\n\nFrom NBC\u2019s Geoff Bennett and Kristen Welker: \u201CCurrent\
      \ and former Federal Election Commission officials tell NBC News it could take\

      \ for the most part, and PNGing dozens of them is more than symbolic \u2014\

      \ had been a double agent.\n\nTwenty-six countries expelled more than 150 Russian\
      \ diplomats in response to the poisoning. According to current and former U.S.\
      \ officials, the Russians had violated one of the unwritten rules of espionage\
      \ \u2014 no assassinations, especially not on another country's soil.\n\nOne\

      \ is crossed, the offended party can expel as PNGs those diplomats it thinks\

      \ that they planned to expel 60 Americans. When the Foreign Ministry announced\
      \ publicly that the Americans had been chosen for expulsion for \"activities\

      \ country \"within a reasonable period\" or risk losing diplomatic immunity.\n\

      \ to the current and former U.S. officials, in both cases the FBI and CIA had\
      \ previously identified the operatives and gave the list to policy makers, who\
      \ made the final decisions. Many of the Russians who fill diplomatic positions\
      \ in the U.S. are actually operatives working for the country's various intelligence\
      \ services.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said\
      \ that the U.S. gave Russia the names of the PNGed individuals after an interagency\
      \ process that included the \"weigh-in\" of many \"U.S. government partners,\"\
      \ like the FBI.\n\n\"We believe our country is safer by making these Russians\

    text: 'The court reasoned at that time that mail-order business was minor compared
      to in-store sales and that catalog retailers would be saddled with too much
      of a burden in having to figure out the correct sales tax, given that taxes
      differ among the states and even among cities within a given state.


      In 1992 and 2015 the court revisited the issue and declined to let states tax
      Internet sales.


      South Dakota, concluding that the business world had radically changed, decided
      to force the issue and passed a law in 2016 requiring Internet retailers to
      collect taxes if they pass a minimum threshold in sales to the state''s residents.


      "Times have changed," the state says in its Supreme Court filing. "Amazon did
      not begin selling books out of Jeff Bezos''s garage until July 1995."


      As for the rule that only companies with physical presence in a state can be
      required to collect taxes, South Dakota says Internet retailers are far more
      present in the lives of state residents than many big-box stores.


      "The Internet now makes it possible for out-of-state sellers to reach consumers
      with engaging, interactive virtual storefronts in our homes or on our smart
      phones at any hour of the day."


      Backed by 36 other states, South Dakota says local governments lose nearly $34
      billion a year in tax revenue because of the physical presence rule.


      South Dakota also says the notion that the nation''s roughly 12,000 different
      state and local tax rates present a burden to Internet retailers is equally
      outdated. Computer programs can instantly calculate the correct tax rate based
      simply on a customer''s address.


      Internet companies that sued to block the South Dakota law, including Overstock.com
      and Wayfair, argue that while the business world has changed, collecting and
      distributing sales taxes remains a burden.


      "The truth is that sales tax collection has become more complex as the number
      of tax jurisdictions has more than doubled since 1992. Moreover, the integration
      of tax collection software is extraordinarily expensive," the companies say
      in their Supreme Court brief.


      NetChoice, a trade association of Internet retailers, says the tax requirement
      would hurt small Internet companies, forcing them to comply with "overbearing
      tax compliance burdens."


      The Trump administration is siding with South Dakota. None of the Supreme Court''s
      earlier decisions "could have foreseen the rise of modern e-commerce," says
      Solicitor General Noel Francisco.'

    text: "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The\
      \ news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nWASHINGTON\
      \ \u2014 The New York Times first reported yesterday that Trump lawyer John\
      \ Dowd floated the possibility of pardons for Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort\
      \ last year, just as special counsel Robert Mueller was investigating the two\
      \ men. The discussions with Flynn and Manafort\u2019s lawyers (which Dowd denies)\
      \ open up a host of new questions about why a Trump lawyer was raising the possibility\
      \ of pardons for individuals who were facing the choice of granting or denying\
      \ cooperation with the probe.\n\nHere are six new questions the story raises\
      \ about Manafort, Flynn and the potential for pardons:\n\n1) Was Dowd acting\
      \ on his own? Or was he speaking for the president? The president is the only\
      \ person who can grant a pardon for federal crimes, so in a more typical presidency,\
      \ it would seem obvious that discussions about pardons would be done with the\
      \ president\u2019s knowledge. But one can also argue that Trump is no regular\
      \ president, and his management style does seem to allow for some freelancing\
      \ from his trusted staff.\n\n2) Why was Dowd the one asking rather than Don\
      \ McGahn? \u2014 Dowd, who resigned last week, was Trump\u2019s personal lawyer,\
      \ not the White House counsel. (That\u2019s Don McGahn.) So why did a personal\
      \ attorney, not the official White House legal mind, have discussions on a power\
      \ that resides firmly in Trump\u2019s role as president, not as a citizen?\n\
      \n3) Does this explain why Manafort isn\u2019t making a deal? Legal experts\
      \ have been scratching their heads about why Manafort hasn\u2019t agreed to\
      \ cooperate with the probe, considering the severity of the charges against\
      \ him. We don\u2019t know if Manafort is holding out for a pardon, but the idea\
      \ that it was floated to his attorney would give some credence to the idea.\n\
      \n4) And if it DOES explain why Manafort didn\u2019t take a deal, why did Flynn\
      \ agree to cooperate? Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller in early December,\
      \ saying that he \u201Cis working to set things right.\u201D If both he and\
      \ Manafort knew that a pardon was on the table, why did they choose different\
      \ paths when it came to cooperation with Mueller? Could it be the cost of an\
      \ extended legal battle, concern that Trump wouldn\u2019t follow through on\
      \ a promise, or something else entirely?\n\n5) Would a federal pardon even be\
      \ enough? Manafort is accused of offenses \u2014 including financial crimes\
      \ \u2014 that are also crimes under state law. But a presidential pardon doesn\u2019\
      t cover charges from state and local authorities. We know that investigators\
      \ in New York have also been probing Manafort\u2019s business dealings, and\
      \ Trump\u2019s pardon wouldn\u2019t apply if state authorities ultimately prosecuted\
      \ the former campaign chairman.\n\n6) Was the White House concerned about what\
      \ Manafort or Flynn would say to the special counsel? This is really the crux\
      \ of the story, and we simply don\u2019t know. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee\
      \ Sanders said in response to this exact question that \u201Cthere was no collusion\
      \ and we\u2019re very confident in that and look forward to this process wrapping\
      \ up.\u201D But if there\u2019s one thing every development in this story underscores\
      \ again and again, it\u2019s that the \u201Cwrapping up\u201D doesn\u2019t seem\
      \ to be happening anytime soon."

      The FBI says that during the 2016 campaign Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort
      and his deputy, Rick Gates, were in touch with a Manafort associate who had
      an ongoing relationship with Russian intelligence, according to court documents
      filed late Tuesday by prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.


      The filings also allege that Gates stated he was aware the Manafort associate
      had once been an officer with Russian military intelligence (GRU). The Manafort
      associate is not named, but is referred to as "Person A" and described as someone
      who the FBI says "has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties
      in 2016."


      Gates pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and making false statements and
      is cooperating with Mueller''s investigation of possible collusion between the
      Trump campaign and Russia.


      Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges that include bank fraud and money
      laundering in connection with his work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.


      Gates had also worked with Manafort in Ukraine.


      The Mueller team provided the FBI''s evaluation of the Manafort associate in
      a pre-sentencing report for another defendant who has pleaded guilty in the
      probe, London-based attorney Alex van der Zwaan. Prosecutors said van der Zwaan
      lied about his contact with Gates, and with Gates''s contact with Person A during
      the 2016 presidential campaign.


      While working for the London office of the Skadden Arps law firm, Van der Zwaan
      had helped compile a 2012 report commissioned by Manafort to defend the prosecution
      of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Manafort worked as a consultant
      for the government of Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych, which had imprisoned
      Tymoshenko.


      During his first interview with the special counsel''s office in 2017, according
      to the report, "van der Zwaan admitted that he knew" Person A was connected
      to Russian intelligence, "stating that Gates told him Person A was a former
      Russian intelligence officer with the GRU."


      But prosecutors say van der Zwaan, who is married to the daughter of a Russian
      billionaire, "lied repeatedly" to Mueller''s prosecutors and "destroyed and
      failed to produce pertinent documents."


      According to prosecutors, van der Zwaan, Gates and Person A had a series of
      conversations in September and October 2016, including a phone call that van
      der Zwaan recorded. Prosecutors say Van der Zwaan concealed the recorded phone
      call from them.'

      \ of Minnesota and Patty Murray of Washington organized the letter to put public\
      \ pressure on Senate leaders to act.\n\n\"Inaction is unacceptable when a survey\

      \ harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill and one out of six women in the same\

      \ and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Everyone deserves to work\
      \ in an environment free from harassment and discrimination,\" they added.\n\
      \nThe legislation was being considered but ultimately not included in a catch-all\
      \ spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law last week. Sources\

      \nMcConnell spokesman David Popp said the majority leader \"supports members\
      \ being personally financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have\
      \ engaged.\" But he added that a bipartisan group of senators are \"continuing\
      \ to work on legislation.\"\n\nPopp would not clarify what work still needed\
      \ to be done. Two pieces of legislation have already been introduced, including\
      \ one by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., that is similar to the measure\

      \ Act of 1995 Reform Act, attempts to create an equal playing field for those\
      \ making harassment complainants while also imposing personal accountability\
      \ on the accused. Just as the accused receives legal support, the bill also\
      \ provides legal representation for the accuser and eliminates burdensome requirements\
      \ that often deter women from pursuing a case.\n\nProvisions pertaining just\
      \ to the House went into effect immediately. However, broader reforms, such\
      \ as the one that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used in settlements,\

      \nSupreme Court to take a new look at partisan gerrymandering\n\nFrom NBC\u2019\
      s Pete Williams: \u201CFor the second time this term, the U.S. Supreme Court\
      \ considers a question that could change the nature of American politics: Is\
      \ it unconstitutional for states to draw the boundary lines for voting districts\
      \ in a blatantly partisan manner? On Wednesday, the justices take up a challenge\
      \ brought by Republicans in Maryland who say Democrats intentionally carved\
      \ up a congressional district to get an electoral edge. A critical issue, as\
      \ was also central for a case heard last fall challenging partisan gerrymandering\
      \ in Wisconsin, is how much partisanship is too much in a process that has always\
      \ been manipulated by political parties in the majority.\u201D\n\nBy taking\
      \ up the pair of cases (one, by the way, in which gerrymandering benefitted\
      \ Republicans and one in which it benefitted Democrats), the court has seemed\
      \ to signal that it\u2019s finally ready to weigh in on an issue they\u2019\
      ve previously stayed away from \u2014 and one with huge potential consequences\
      \ for American politics. The justice to watch in today\u2019s oral arguments,\
      \ by the way? Anthony Kennedy, who gave the deciding vote in 2004 that kept\
      \ the court out of partisan gerrymandering for the time being, even while saying\
      \ he was open to revisiting the issue.\n\nFor David Shulkin, no confidence but\
      \ also no \u201Cyou\u2019re fired\u201D \u2014 yet\n\nPlenty of folks have noted\
      \ that, for a former reality star whose catchphrase was \u201Cyou\u2019re fired,\u201D\
      \ President Trump has been notably averse to announcing personnel changes quickly\
      \ and decisively. VA chief David Shulkin, who has been subject to rumors of\
      \ his dismissal for weeks but has not yet been fired, is the latest example.\
      \ After his ouster seemed imminent at the beginning of the week, Shulkin is\
      \ still on the job even as the White House has \u2014 at best \u2014 sent mixed\
      \ messages about his future.\n\nPart of the reason for the delay, by the way,\
      \ is that there isn\u2019t a clear replacement for Shulkin, and the pick could\
      \ face a difficult confirmation hearing. But Trump\u2019s habit of leaving members\
      \ of his own team twisting in the wind for days, weeks or even months on end\
      \ (see: Tillerson, Rex), also means that the sprawling government agencies that\
      \ they lead are also left in limbo, wondering at any given moment who \u2014\
      \ if anyone \u2014 is in charge."

      \ \u2014 The numbers are in: Americans are fired up.\n\nMore than half of Americans\
      \ \u2014 57 percent \u2014 say they are outraged enough about an issue that\
      \ they would carry a protest sign for a day, according to a recent NBC News/Wall\
      \ Street Journal poll on social trends.\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to shares\
      \ in 2014 and 2015 who said the same, but the survey also finds that the political\
      \ gravity has shifted in the interim towards the left \u2014 and the issue of\
      \ guns and gun control.\n\nIn 2014, 61 percent of Democrats said they felt passionate\
      \ enough to carry a protest sign, while 60 percent of independents and 54 percent\
      \ of Republicans said the same.\n\nNow, the share among independents has fallen\
      \ to just 43 percent, while Republicans have ticked down to 50 percent. But\
      \ among Democrats, nearly seven-in-ten \u2014 69 percent \u2014 now say they\
      \ are upset enough about an issue to protest it.\n\nWhat Americans are protesting\
      \ about has changed significantly too, perhaps most vividly illustrated by last\
      \ weekend\u2019s nationwide demonstration of support for victims of the Parkland\
      \ school shooting.\n\nGuns are now the dominant topic named by both Republicans\
      \ and Democrats when asked what they would use a protest sign to convey.\n\n\
      Here's what a word cloud of the Democratic responses to the open-ended poll\
      \ question looked like:\n\nHart Research\n\nAnd here are the Republican responses:\n\
      \nHart Research\n\nThat\u2019s a change from 2014 and 2015, when abortion and\
      \ immigration dominated among respondents on the right, while those on the left\
      \ cited a hodgepodge of issues including health care, funding Planned Parenthood,\
      \ the Black Lives Matter movement and getting money out of politics.\n\nThe\
      \ NBC/WSJ \u201Csocial trends\u201D poll was conducted March 10-14, about a\
      \ month after the Parkland shooting but before the gun control-focused March\
      \ for Our Lives.\n\n\u201CThe question keeps being raised: \u2018After Parkland,\
      \ will this one be different?\u2019\u201D said Republican pollster Bill McInturff,\
      \ who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. \u201CAt\
      \ a minimum we can say that this is different in that it\u2019s dominating the\
      \ national debate on both sides.\u201D\n\nGender equality, racial equality top\
      \ list of important political movements in America\n\nWhile guns remain a dominant\
      \ \u2014 but divisive \u2014 issue, the poll\u2019s respondents also cited the\
      \ pushes for both gender and racial equality as the most important political\
      \ movements in America overall. Twenty-eight percent of Americans (including\
      \ 15 percent of Republicans, 27 percent of independents and 41 percent of Democrats)\
      \ named the fight against sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace\
      \ as the most important movement.\n\nSimilar shares (27 percent overall \u2014\
      \ including 10 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 44 percent\
      \ of Democrats) cited the movement for greater racial equality.\n\nAlmost half\
      \ of Republicans said that \u201Cprotecting our borders and limiting immigration\u201D\
      \ is the most important political cause in America today, while about four-in-ten\
      \ Democrats pointed to efforts to address climate change.\n\nSupport for abortion\
      \ rights hits a high\n\nThe poll found that 55 percent of Americans believe\
      \ that abortion should be legal all or most of the time, while 43 percent disagree.\
      \ That\u2019s a record high level of support since the poll began asking the\
      \ question in 2003; the previous high was in January 2013, when 54 percent supported\
      \ all or most abortion as legal, while 44 percent disagreed.\n\nSupport for\
      \ legal abortion in all or most cases outweighs opposition in most subgroups,\
      \ but opposition to abortion in all or most cases is the dominant position among\
      \ Republicans, Trump voters, rural Americans, and seniors.\n\nPartisan and generational\
      \ gaps in views of a changing America\n\nAs the country faces continued demographic\
      \ and political change, the majority of Americans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say\
      \ that they are comfortable with the country\u2019s increasing diversity and\
      \ tolerance for different lifestyles, gender roles, and other experiences. That\
      \ includes 53 percent of independents and 74 percent of Democrats, but just\
      \ 29 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe 25 percent of Americans overall who say\
      \ they are uneasy with these changes include a plurality of Trump voters \u2014\
      \ 44 percent \u2014 while 23 percent say they are comfortable and an additional\
      \ 29 percent say they fall into neither category.\n\nMillennials are particularly\
      \ comfortable in this new cultural environment. Almost two-thirds of those aged\
      \ 18 to 36 \u2014 64 percent \u2014 say they embrace increasing diversity and\
      \ tolerance, while just 16 percent say they are uncomfortable with it. Among\
      \ those who are Baby Boomers and older, 49 percent say they are comfortable\
      \ while 31 percent are uneasy.\n\nSome of that gap may be reflected in the different\
      \ ways that the two generations experience the world.\n\nFully 85 percent of\
      \ millennials, but a lower 67 percent of Boomers (aged 58-75) , say they have\
      \ a friend who is gay, bisexual or transgender. And while the same share of\
      \ millennials \u2014 85 percent \u2014 say they use social media every day,\
      \ just about half of Boomers say the same.\n\nThe live-caller NBC/WSJ poll was\
      \ conducted March 10-14 of 1,100 adults \u2013 nearly half reached by cell phone\
      \ \u2013 and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.0 percentage\

      \ woman was sentenced to five years behind bars this week for voting illegally\
      \ in the 2016 election while on supervised release from federal prison.\n\n\
      Crystal Mason, 43, testified in court that she did not know that she was ineligible\
      \ to vote due to her 2011 fraud conviction before casting a provisional ballot\
      \ in the presidential election. In Texas, knowingly voting illegally is a second-degree\
      \ felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nCrystal Mason was sentenced\
      \ to a five year prison sentence this week, after she tried to vote while on\
      \ supervised release from federal prison, in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant\
      \ County Jail\n\n\"A second degree felony for voting illegally? That's outrageous,\"\
      \ J. Warren St. John, her defense attorney, told NBC News on Friday. \"The punishment\
      \ does not fit this crime.\"\n\nTexas' ballot asks voters to certify that they\
      \ have completed their sentences \u2014 including supervision \u2014 if they\
      \ have previously been convicted of a felony. Mason testified in court that\
      \ she did not read the fine print because an election worker was helping her\
      \ with the provisional ballot.\n\n\"She voted in good faith,\" St. John said,\
      \ noting that she accurately filled out her own information and wasn't trying\
      \ to obscure her identity. \"She didn\u2019t intentionally vote illegally and\
      \ that\u2019s the whole issue.\"\n\nMason had pleaded guilty in 2011 to inflating\
      \ tax returns while working as a tax preparer and was sentenced to 60 months\
      \ in federal prison, according to her attorney. She had served roughly three\
      \ years before being released in 2016.\n\nSt. John said that Mason was never\
      \ told in court, prison, or her halfway house that she couldn't vote until the\
      \ entirety of her sentence was complete. Her probation officer also testified\
      \ in court that he had not told her she couldn't vote.\n\nMason is appealing\
      \ the judge's ruling, and out on bond pending that appeal. Because the crime\
      \ is also a violation of her supervised release, she could still be arrested\
      \ by federal authorities and sentenced to additional federal jail time for violating\
      \ the terms of her release. St. John said federal court had not yet issued a\
      \ warrant over the violation, however.\n\nMason is not the first to receive\
      \ a severe sentence for voting illegally. A Texas resident and Mexican citizen\
      \ with a green card, Rosa Maria Ortega, was sentenced to eight years in prison\
      \ for casting an illegal ballot. Ortega had even served as a poll worker, and\
      \ she, too, reportedly said she did not know she couldn\u2019t vote.\n\nStill,\
      \ not everyone gets hard time. A North Carolina prosecutor declined to bring\
      \ charges against a woman who said she cast an illegal vote for Donald Trump\
      \ in order to fulfill her mother's dying wish. \"She made a mistake out of sheer\
      \ ignorance without any intent to defraud or commit a crime,\" the prosecutor\
      \ said, according to a local report.\n\nAn estimated 6.1 million Americans are\
      \ disenfranchised by a felony conviction, something many states are rethinking\
      \ as those numbers continue to rise alongside skyrocketing incarceration rates."

      \ said. \"That's something that has to happen.\"\n\nThat sentiment stems from\

      \ backers, note that Schubert campaigned for a state ballot question in 2016\
      \ that sped up the capital appeals process so that people sentenced to death\
      \ actually get executed. She is also a leading voice in favor of a proposed\
      \ state ballot question that would roll back laws aimed at reducing the state's\

      \ and hybrids to more gas-hungry SUVs and pickups.\n\nNot all automakers support\

      \ and key auto suppliers who support the 54.5 mpg target, according to a new\
      \ study by CALSTART, a California-based consortium aimed at developing clean\
      \ transportation technologies.\n\n\u201CWe found that suppliers strongly support\

      \ figure is a little misleading. Due to adjustments in testing procedures and\
      \ credits the industry can earn, the actual target is in the low to mid-40 mpg\
      \ range.\n\nMost experts agree that figure is possible, but the question is\
      \ at what cost \u2014 and with what impact. The general consensus is that the\
      \ standard will require a sharp increase in the use of electrified powertrain\
      \ technologies, including conventional hybrids, plug-ins, and battery-electric\
      \ vehicles, or BEVs. A 2010 study by the Center for Automotive Research, in\

      \ December forecast that by the time the 54.5 mpg target goes into effect the\
      \ cost of owning and operating an all-electric vehicle would be roughly comparable\
      \ to a conventional gas model.\n\nIronically, even as automakers have pushed\

      \ GM plans to have around two dozen BEVs in its showrooms by mid-decade. Volkswagen\
      \ will launch 50 by the same time. Volvo says every model it sells will use\
      \ some form of electrification, a target several other marques, including Infiniti,\
      \ have also laid out. Nissan announced plans last week to add an assortment\
      \ of its own pure electric models, and Carlos Ghosn, CEO of the Renault Nissan\
      \ Alliance, said in an interview last autumn that the Japanese side of the group\
      \ will not back off of its mileage commitment no matter what the EPA decides.\n\

      \ news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nWASHINGTON\
      \ \u2014 America has always had its culture wars, and they're only intensified\
      \ when news events big and small are filtered through the prism of Donald Trump.\
      \ (The latest debates over the Census question on citizenship, the transgender\
      \ military ban, the Laura Ingraham vs. David Hogg conflict and even the popularity\
      \ of the \"Roseanne\" reboot are just a handful of recent reminders.)\n\nAnd\
      \ the continuing divide over a changing American culture shows why the wars\
      \ continue to rage. In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 54 percent\
      \ of Americans said that they are comfortable with American society becoming\
      \ more diverse and tolerant of different lifestyles, gender roles, languages\
      \ and other experiences, while 25 percent said that the changes make them uneasy.\n\
      \nBut the geographic, generational and \u2014 yes \u2014 partisan differences\
      \ over the changing culture also show us some of the broad outlines of the two\
      \ party coalitions.\n\nHere's a closer look at who's comfortable and who's uneasy\
      \ with a changing culture.\n\nMost comfortable\n\nClinton voters: 80 percent\n\
      \nLiberals: 80 percent\n\nPrefer a Democratic Congress in November: 77 percent\n\
      \nDemocrats: 74 percent\n\nWhites with a college degree: 64 percent\n\nMillennials:\
      \ 64 percent\n\nUrban dwellers: 62 percent\n\nMost uneasy\n\nPrefer a Republican\
      \ Congress in November: 45 percent\n\nTrump voters: 44 percent\n\nRepublicans:\
      \ 43 percent\n\nConservatives: 43 percent\n\nRural dwellers: 35 percent\n\n\
      Whites without a college degree: 32 percent\n\nBaby Boomers and older: 31 percent\n\
      \nOn abortion and Planned Parenthood\n\nAnother key finding in the newly-released\
      \ data showed that support for abortion rights has hit a new high. Fifty-five\
      \ percent of Americans now say that abortion should be legal in all or most\
      \ cases, while 43 percent say that it should be illegal in all or most cases.\
      \ Also hitting a new high: The popularity of Planned Parenthood, which is now\
      \ rated positively by 52 percent of Americans, compared to 25 percent who rate\
      \ it negatively. (That\u2019s up from 45 percent positive/ 30 percent negative\
      \ in July 2015.)\n\nHere\u2019s a subtle but interesting disparity between those\
      \ two numbers, by the way, that provides some insight into how the politics\
      \ around funding for Planned Parenthood aren\u2019t the same as the politics\
      \ around abortion generally.\n\nOn the issue of whether abortion should be legal,\
      \ there\u2019s little daylight between whites and nonwhites (who favor legal\
      \ abortion in all or most cases by a net 11 and 13 percentage points, respectively.)\
      \ But when it comes to favorability for Planned Parenthood, nonwhites are significantly\
      \ more positive than whites. Nearly six-in-ten (59 percent) view the organization\
      \ positively, while just 13 percent view it negatively; among whites, it\u2019\
      s 49 percent positive, 30 percent negative.\n\nThe difference is even more stark\
      \ among those with lower levels of education. Among those with a high school\
      \ education or less, a majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say abortion should\
      \ be illegal in all or most cases, compared to 42 percent who say it should\
      \ be legal all or most cases. But in the same subgroup, Planned Parenthood has\
      \ a net positive rating by a big margin, with 48 percent viewing it positively\
      \ and just 25 percent viewing it negatively.\n\n\u201CThis is a reminder about\
      \ the role Planned Parenthood plays in providing health care services and who\
      \ those services are being directed towards,\u201D said Republican pollster\
      \ Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Fred\
      \ Yang.\n\nNew VA pick is getting pummeled on qualifications. That could be\
      \ tough to recover from\n\nThe first 36 hours for new Veterans Affairs nominee\
      \ Dr. Ronny Jackson have been, well, a little bumpy. Congressional Republicans\
      \ and veterans groups are being very cautious (at best) about his unexpected\
      \ selection. And most of the coverage has focused on how he would be walking\
      \ into a leadership position in the government\u2019s second-largest bureaucracy\
      \ without any meaningful management experience.\n\nControversies for incoming\
      \ nominees over policy, past statements or potential conflicts can be tricky\
      \ \u2014 but also surmountable for many candidates if they handle them the right\
      \ way. But skepticism over inexperience can be one of the hardest questions\
      \ to overcome. (Remember Harriet Miers?) We know that this president is loath\
      \ to change course, but if this level of criticism keeps up, it wouldn\u2019\
      t be shocking to start seeing some leaks about some second thoughts from the\
      \ West Wing.\n\nTrump to Putin: \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can\
      \ do that, but I'll win.\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s NBC\u2019s latest reporting on\
      \ how Trump has urged aides not to tout moves to crack down on Russia, from\
      \ NBC\u2019s Carol Lee, Courtney Kube and Kristen Welker: \u201CPresident Donald\
      \ Trump's national security advisers spent months trying to convince him to\
      \ sign off on a plan to supply new U.S. weapons to Ukraine to aid in the country's\
      \ fight against Russian-backed separatists, according to multiple senior administration\
      \ officials. Yet when the president finally authorized the major policy shift,\
      \ he told his aides not to publicly tout his decision, officials said. Doing\
      \ so, Trump argued, might agitate Russian President Vladimir Putin, according\
      \ to the officials\u2026.\n\n\"Officials said the increasingly puzzling divide\
      \ between Trump's policy decisions and public posture on Russia stems from his\
      \ continued hope for warmer relations with Putin and stubborn refusal to be\
      \ seen as appeasing the media or critics who question his silence or kind words\
      \ for the Russian leader.\u201D\n\nMore: \u201CBehind the scenes, however, Trump\
      \ has recently taken a sharper tone on Putin, administration officials said,\
      \ but the shift seems more a reaction to the Russian leader challenging the\
      \ president's strength than a new belief that he's an adversary. Putin's claim\
      \ earlier this month that Russia has new nuclear-capable weapons that could\
      \ hit the U.S., a threat he underscored with video simulating an attack, \"\
      really got under the president's skin,\" one official said\u2026 Two officials\
      \ said Trump told Putin during a phone call last week after Putin's re-election:\
      \ \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can do that, but I'll win.\u2019\
      \u201D\n\nRussia test-fires another missile after expelling dozens of U.S. diplomats\n\
      \nOf course, these Trump-Putin revelations come as Russia claims that it has\
      \ test-fired a missile of the type that Putin bragged about (when he \u201C\
      got under the president\u2019s skin.\u201D) \u2026 *And* as Russia is retaliating\
      \ for the expulsion of 60 of its diplomats from the United States by expelling\
      \ 60 American diplomats from its own country. \u2026 *And* as POLITICO is reporting\
      \ that Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has been pleading\
      \ with Sen. Orrin Hatch for help securing meetings with U.S. lawmakers and officials\
      \ who have refused or ignored his requests.\n\nOn the TODAY show, Antonov said\
      \ of the current tensions: \"It depends upon us to decide whether we are in\
      \ Cold War or not. But ... I don't remember such [a] bad shape of our relations.\u201D\
      \n\nSessions won\u2019t name a second special counsel to probe alleged FBI bias\n\
      \nEarlier this month, we noticed that some noteworthy members of Republican\
      \ leadership were joining the call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint\
      \ a special counsel to look at allegations of political bias in the FBI. Yesterday,\
      \ we got our answer from Sessions: No dice. (although he does say that the U.S.\
      \ attorney in Utah is also probing the issue, in addition to the DOJ inspector\
      \ general.)\n\nHere\u2019s more from NBC\u2019s Pete Williams: \u201CAppointing\
      \ a special counsel, Sessions said Thursday, is \"by design, reserved for use\
      \ in only the most extraordinary circumstances.\" He noted that since the special\
      \ counsel rules were established in 1999, they've been invoked only twice. In\
      \ the meantime, Sessions said, the Justice Department \u2018has successfully\
      \ investigated and prosecuted many high-profile, resource-intensive matters.\u2019\

      \ \u2014 The numbers are in: Americans are fired up.\n\nMore than half of Americans\
      \ \u2014 57 percent \u2014 say they are outraged enough about an issue that\
      \ they would carry a protest sign for a day, according to a recent NBC News/Wall\
      \ Street Journal poll on social trends.\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to shares\
      \ in 2014 and 2015 who said the same, but the survey also finds that the political\
      \ gravity has shifted in the interim towards the left \u2014 and the issue of\
      \ guns and gun control.\n\nIn 2014, 61 percent of Democrats said they felt passionate\
      \ enough to carry a protest sign, while 60 percent of independents and 54 percent\
      \ of Republicans said the same.\n\nNow, the share among independents has fallen\
      \ to just 43 percent, while Republicans have ticked down to 50 percent. But\
      \ among Democrats, nearly seven-in-ten \u2014 69 percent \u2014 now say they\
      \ are upset enough about an issue to protest it.\n\nWhat Americans are protesting\
      \ about has changed significantly too, perhaps most vividly illustrated by last\
      \ weekend\u2019s nationwide demonstration of support for victims of the Parkland\
      \ school shooting.\n\nGuns are now the dominant topic named by both Republicans\
      \ and Democrats when asked what they would use a protest sign to convey.\n\n\
      Here's what a word cloud of the Democratic responses to the open-ended poll\
      \ question looked like:\n\nHart Research\n\nAnd here are the Republican responses:\n\
      \nHart Research\n\nThat\u2019s a change from 2014 and 2015, when abortion and\
      \ immigration dominated among respondents on the right, while those on the left\
      \ cited a hodgepodge of issues including health care, funding Planned Parenthood,\
      \ the Black Lives Matter movement and getting money out of politics.\n\nThe\
      \ NBC/WSJ \u201Csocial trends\u201D poll was conducted March 10-14, about a\
      \ month after the Parkland shooting but before the gun control-focused March\
      \ for Our Lives.\n\n\u201CThe question keeps being raised: \u2018After Parkland,\
      \ will this one be different?\u2019\u201D said Republican pollster Bill McInturff,\
      \ who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. \u201CAt\
      \ a minimum we can say that this is different in that it\u2019s dominating the\
      \ national debate on both sides.\u201D\n\nGender equality, racial equality top\
      \ list of important political movements in America\n\nWhile guns remain a dominant\
      \ \u2014 but divisive \u2014 issue, the poll\u2019s respondents also cited the\
      \ pushes for both gender and racial equality as the most important political\
      \ movements in America overall. Twenty-eight percent of Americans (including\
      \ 15 percent of Republicans, 27 percent of independents and 41 percent of Democrats)\
      \ named the fight against sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace\
      \ as the most important movement.\n\nSimilar shares (27 percent overall \u2014\
      \ including 10 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 44 percent\
      \ of Democrats) cited the movement for greater racial equality.\n\nAlmost half\
      \ of Republicans said that \u201Cprotecting our borders and limiting immigration\u201D\
      \ is the most important political cause in America today, while about four-in-ten\
      \ Democrats pointed to efforts to address climate change.\n\nSupport for abortion\
      \ rights hits a high\n\nThe poll found that 55 percent of Americans believe\
      \ that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 43 percent disagree,\
      \ saying it should be illegal in all of most cases. That\u2019s a record high\
      \ level of support since the poll began asking the question in 2003; the previous\
      \ high was in January 2013, when 54 percent supported all or most abortion as\
      \ legal, while 44 percent disagreed.\n\nSupport for legal abortion in all or\
      \ most cases outweighs opposition in most subgroups, but opposition to abortion\
      \ in all or most cases is the dominant position among Republicans, Trump voters,\
      \ rural Americans, and seniors.\n\nPartisan and generational gaps in views of\
      \ a changing America\n\nAs the country faces continued demographic and political\
      \ change, the majority of Americans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say that they are\
      \ comfortable with the country\u2019s increasing diversity and tolerance for\
      \ different lifestyles, gender roles, and other experiences. That includes 53\
      \ percent of independents and 74 percent of Democrats, but just 29 percent of\
      \ Republicans.\n\nThe 25 percent of Americans overall who say they are uneasy\
      \ with these changes include a plurality of Trump voters \u2014 44 percent \u2014\
      \ while 23 percent say they are comfortable and an additional 29 percent say\
      \ they fall into neither category.\n\nMillennials are particularly comfortable\
      \ in this new cultural environment. Almost two-thirds of those aged 18 to 36\
      \ \u2014 64 percent \u2014 say they embrace increasing diversity and tolerance,\
      \ while just 16 percent say they are uncomfortable with it. Among those who\
      \ are Baby Boomers and older, 49 percent say they are comfortable while 31 percent\
      \ are uneasy.\n\nSome of that gap may be reflected in the different ways that\
      \ the two generations experience the world.\n\nFully 85 percent of millennials,\
      \ but a lower 67 percent of Boomers (aged 58-75) , say they have a friend who\

      \ 85 percent \u2014 say they use social media every day, just about half of\

      \ as American motorists begin switching from smaller, fuel-efficient sedans\
      \ and hybrids to more gas-hungry SUVs and pickups.\n\nNot all automakers support\
      \ a rollback, however, and the debate has led to an unusual split between manufacturers\
      \ and key auto suppliers who support the 54.5 mpg target, according to a new\
      \ study by CALSTART, a California-based consortium aimed at developing clean\
      \ transportation technologies.\n\n\u201CWe found that suppliers strongly support\

      \ said CALSTART President John Boesel. \u201CThey felt (the 54.5 mpg target\
      \ for 2025) was feasible and do-able.\u201D\n\nUnder the Obama administration,\
      \ the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards were raised twice after\
      \ years of stagnation. The current targets aims to boost the mileage of the\
      \ average new vehicle sold in the U.S. to 54.5 mpg by 2025 \u2014 though that\
      \ figure is a little misleading. Due to adjustments in testing procedures and\
      \ credits the industry can earn, the actual target is in the low to mid-40 mpg\
      \ range.\n\nMost experts agree that figure is possible, but the question is\
      \ at what cost \u2014 and with what impact. The general consensus is that the\
      \ standard will require a sharp increase in the use of electrified powertrain\
      \ technologies, including conventional hybrids, plug-ins, and battery-electric\
      \ vehicles, or BEVs. A 2010 study by the Center for Automotive Research, in\
      \ Ann Arbor, Michigan indicated this would add thousands of dollars to the cost\
      \ of the typical vehicle and, by driving down new vehicle demand, cost tens\
      \ of thousands of industry jobs.\n\nRelated Trump orders EPA to review fuel\
      \ economy standards\n\nBut other research suggests such dire warnings are overblown.\
      \ The price of current state-of-the-art lithium batteries has fallen by over\
      \ 70 percent since the beginning of the decade, when the 2025 standards were\
      \ being negotiated. And a study released by the Boston Consulting Group last\
      \ December forecast that by the time the 54.5 mpg target goes into effect the\
      \ cost of owning and operating an all-electric vehicle would be roughly comparable\
      \ to a conventional gas model.\n\nIronically, even as automakers have pushed\
      \ for a rollback, they have radically ramped up their electrification programs.\
      \ GM plans to have around two dozen BEVs in its showrooms by mid-decade. Volkswagen\
      \ will launch 50 by the same time. Volvo says every model it sells will use\
      \ some form of electrification, a target several other marques, including Infiniti,\
      \ have also laid out. Nissan announced plans last week to add an assortment\
      \ of its own pure electric models, and Carlos Ghosn, CEO of the Renault Nissan\
      \ Alliance, said in an interview last autumn that the Japanese side of the group\
      \ will not back off of its mileage commitment no matter what the EPA decides.\n\
      \nThe administration could completely gut the program, says one expert. The\
      \ administration could completely gut the program, says one expert.\n\nThe administration\

      \ of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, the department that\
      \ helped negotiate the 2010 mileage compromise, has warned.\n\nExactly how much\
      \ of a cut Pruitt will call for is uncertain and there is some concern that\
      \ he might also try to eliminate the special exemption Congress wrote into the\
      \ 1970 Clean Air Act for the traditionally smoggy state of California. It currently\
      \ has the right to set its own emissions targets, routinely tougher than the\
      \ EPA\u2019s national standards. By lowering acceptable levels of CO2, blamed\
      \ for global warming, California can effectively force higher mileage targets\
      \ even if the national standard drops.\n\nAnd 11 other states \u2014 collectively\
      \ accounting for about one-third of the American new car market \u2014 have\
      \ adopted the California guidelines.\n\nFor his part, EPA chief Pruitt has said\
      \ \u201CCalifornia is not the arbiter\u201D of mileage rules and insisted the\

    text: 'Justina Fugh, an ethics lawyer at EPA, told The Associated Press on Friday
      Pruitt''s rental agreement allowed him to only pay for nights he occupied the
      room, totaling about $6,000 in payments over the term of the lease.


      Fugh said she was first briefed by other EPA officials about the terms of lease
      on Thursday, shortly after ABC News first reported on Pruitt''s prior living
      arrangements. Fugh said she was not asked to review the lease or issue a formal
      legal opinion on it, though she did not immediately see it as an ethical concern
      since Pruitt paid for the room.


      Fugh said she was told Pruitt has since moved to another apartment, though she
      said she was not privy to any details about where the administrator is currently
      staying, who owns that property or what rate he is paying.


      Inside the White House on Friday, staffers expressed frustration by the optics
      of Pruitt''s living arrangements, which come on the heels of the dismissal of
      Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin over ethical missteps.


      But while officials in the West Wing are reviewing the seriousness of the questions
      around Pruitt, it was too soon to know if the EPA secretary would face harsh
      internal questioning or draw the ire of President''s Donald Trump, according
      to a White House official not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.


      A Republican who previously served as the state attorney general of Oklahoma,
      Pruitt has long been a champion of the oil and gas industry. In the year he
      has served as the Trump administration''s top environmental official, Pruitt
      has moved to scrap, gut or replace numerous environmental regulations opposed
      by the industry while boosting the continued burning of fossil fuels, which
      is the primary cause of climate change.


      In December, Pruitt and members of his staff spent about $40,000 in taxpayer
      funds to fly to Morocco to help encourage the North African kingdom to import
      liquefied natural gas from the United States. Cheniere, the lobbying client
      of Hart''s firm, is currently the only exporter of liquefied natural gas from
      the continental United States.


      In a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday, Hart said Pruitt is a casual
      friend from Oklahoma who moved into the building in early 2017. Hart said he
      had no contact with Pruitt for many months, other than a brief exchange at the
      National Prayer Breakfast in February.


      "Pruitt signed a market based, short-term lease for a condo owned partially
      by my wife," Hart said, according to a statement released by his firm. "Pruitt
      paid all rent owed as agreed to in the lease. My wife does not, and has not
      ever lobbied the EPA on any matters."


      Hart''s wife, Vicki Hart, is also a lobbyist, focusing on health care issues.


      EPA''s press office also did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday
      or Friday about Pruitt''s Washington living arrangements.


      The $50 a night rate Pruitt paid is significantly less than advertised rates
      for rentals in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where the unit is located. One
      bedroom apartments listed for rent in the immediate area on Friday ranged between
      $1,600 and $2,500 a month, depending on amenities. Single rooms listed online
      for one-night rentals averaged about $120 a night.


      Pruitt has been under increasing scrutiny for this frequent taxpayer-funded
      travel, which has included first-class airline tickets. Though federal regulations
      typically require federal officials to fly in coach, the EPA chief has said
      he needed to sit in premium seats due to security concerns.


      After a series of recent media reports about questionable spending, Pruitt was
      one four high-ranking Trump officials who met separately with White House Cabinet
      Secretary William McGinley to discuss proper ethics practices.


      The president is still said to be fond of Pruitt and has applauded the EPA secretary
      for his attention-grabbing dust-ups with environmentalist groups, according
      to the White House official and an outside Trump adviser.


      Both a House oversight committee and the EPA''s inspector general are now reviewing
      Pruitt''s travel spending. Jeffrey Lagda, a spokesman for EPA''s internal watchdog,
      said Friday that the office has been "made aware of the allegations related
      to Administrator Pruitt''s living arrangements last year."


      Pruitt''s EPA travel has also often included weekend-long layovers at his home
      in Tulsa. The EPA chief is widely mentioned in Oklahoma as a possible successor
      to Sen. James Inhofe, the state''s octogenarian GOP senator who is expected
      to retire at the end of his current term.


      Among the clients at Hart''s lobbying firm is OGE Energy Corp., an electricity
      company serving Oklahoma and Arkansas. According to federal disclosure reports,
      the company paid Williams and Jensen $400,000 in 2017 to lobby on issues that
      included EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.


      Copies of Pruitt''s daily calendar obtained by the AP through a public records
      request show that Pruitt held a March 2017 meeting in his EPA office with OGE
      Chairman and CEO Sean Trauschke and company vice president Paul Renfrow. The
      meeting was arranged at the request of George Baker, a registered lobbyist from
      Hart''s firm, who also attended.


      In October, EPA announced it would rewrite the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era
      regulation that sought to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired
      power plants like those operated by OGE. EPA has also moved to scrap regulations
      cutting power plant emissions of such toxic substances as mercury, as well as
      tighter standards on dumps containing coal ash.


      Records show Pruitt has had a long relationship with OGE. Campaign finance reports
      from Oklahoma show more than three dozen OGE executives donated to Pruitt''s
      2014 re-election campaign for state attorney general, even though he was running
      without a Democratic opponent. OGE chairman Peter Delaney contributed $3,500,
      while Trauschke kicked in $2,500 and Renfrow contributed $1,000.


      Environmental groups pointed to news of Pruitt''s living arrangements as further
      evidence he caters to polluters, and they renewed their calls for him to resign.


      "Scott Pruitt got a sweetheart deal on a D.C. condo directly from a fossil fuel
      lobbyist, then wasted thousands in taxpayer dollars pushing that lobbyist''s
      agenda on a trip to Morocco," said Michael Brune, the executive director of
      the Sierra Club. "This deal stinks like the swamp Scott Pruitt is mired in."'

      \ in order to fulfill her mother's dying wish. \"She made a mistake out of sheer\
      \ ignorance without any intent to defraud or commit a crime,\" the prosecutor\
      \ said, according to a local report.\n\nAn estimated 6.1 million Americans are\
      \ disenfranchised by a felony conviction, something many states are rethinking\
      \ as those numbers continue to rise alongside skyrocketing incarceration rates."

      many people don't even know they get to elect their local DA.\"\n\nSacramento\
      \ ACT is partnering with the American Civil Liberties Union to change that through\
      \ voter-education efforts, including public forums and door-to-door canvassing.\
      \ The two groups do not endorse candidates, but encourage voters to support\
      \ those who align with a reform agenda.\n\n\"In the case of Mr. Clark, people\
      \ are ready to see a fair and just investigation and charges pressed,\" Trejo\
      \ said. \"That's something that has to happen.\"\n\nThat sentiment stems from\
      \ lingering anger over the 2016 case, in which Schubert declined to prosecute\
      \ two officers who shot to death Joseph Mann, 50.\n\nSacramento County prosecutor\
      \ Noah Phillips makes his closing statement as Orville Fleming sits in Sacramento\
      \ Superior Court on June 22, 2015 in Sacramento, California. Hector Amezcua\

      \ if elected, part of his pledge to \"hold law enforcement transparent, which\
      \ my opponent does not believe in.\" He was less clear about the Clark case,\
      \ saying he would visit Clark's family, give the public \"an opportunity to\
      \ be heard,\" and hold officers accountable for any \"criminal wrongdoing.\"\
      \n\nSchubert, in an interview, defended her decision on Mann, which she explained\
      \ in a January 2017 public report. \"The review process was completed in a fair\
      \ and independent manner,\" she said.\n\nShe declined to comment on the Clark\
      \ case beyond calling it a \"tremendous tragedy\" and promising to \"conduct\
      \ a full, fair and independent review\" when police investigators hand the case\
      \ to her. She also said she welcomed a move by the state attorney general this\
      \ week to oversee the investigation.\n\nSchubert said she has worked to improve\
      \ her office's relationship with the public, through youth law enforcement academies\
      \ and literacy programs. She also said she enjoys support of the county's top\
      \ Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCritics, including Phillips, Bond and their\
      \ backers, note that Schubert campaigned for a state ballot question in 2016\
      \ that sped up the capital appeals process so that people sentenced to death\
      \ actually get executed. She is also a leading voice in favor of a proposed\
      \ state ballot question that would roll back laws aimed at reducing the state's\
      \ prison population. The proposal includes an expanded list of violent crimes\
      \ for which offenders cannot be released early from prison and lower thresholds\
      \ for the amount of stolen goods counted under the crime of serial theft.\n\n\
      An ACLU of California website aimed at helping people find out more about their\
      \ local district attorney notes that Schubert was out of step with a majority\
      \ of Sacramento voters on ballot initiatives aimed at reducing prison populations.\n\
      \nSchubert said the characterization of her as resisting reform was false.\n\
      \n\"This is a very measured approach, not designed to put more people in prison,\"\
      \ she said.\n\nShe said she has prosecuted officers for other serious offenses,\
      \ including rape. And she said she supports changing state law so that people\
      \ who participate in a crime that leads to someone getting killed would not\
      \ face as much prison time as those who did the killing.\n\nShe called Phillips\
      \ \"an opportunist\" who has wrongly tried to link her to President Donald Trump;\
      \ Schubert said she did not vote for the president.\n\nOn Thursday, as the Sacramento\
      \ chapter of Black Lives Matter planned a third consecutive day of protests\

      \ news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nWASHINGTON\
      \ \u2014 America has always had its culture wars, and they're only intensified\
      \ when news events big and small are filtered through the prism of Donald Trump.\
      \ (The latest debates over the Census question on citizenship, the transgender\
      \ military ban, the Laura Ingraham vs. David Hogg conflict and even the popularity\
      \ of the \"Roseanne\" reboot are just a handful of recent reminders.)\n\nAnd\
      \ the continuing divide over a changing American culture shows why the wars\
      \ continue to rage. In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 54 percent\
      \ of Americans said that they are comfortable with American society becoming\
      \ more diverse and tolerant of different lifestyles, gender roles, languages\
      \ and other experiences, while 25 percent said that the changes make them uneasy.\n\
      \nBut the geographic, generational and \u2014 yes \u2014 partisan differences\
      \ over the changing culture also show us some of the broad outlines of the two\
      \ party coalitions.\n\nHere's a closer look at who's comfortable and who's uneasy\
      \ with a changing culture.\n\nMost comfortable\n\nClinton voters: 80 percent\n\
      \nLiberals: 80 percent\n\nPrefer a Democratic Congress in November: 77 percent\n\
      \nDemocrats: 74 percent\n\nWhites with a college degree: 64 percent\n\nMillennials:\
      \ 64 percent\n\nUrban dwellers: 62 percent\n\nMost uneasy\n\nPrefer a Republican\
      \ Congress in November: 45 percent\n\nTrump voters: 44 percent\n\nRepublicans:\
      \ 43 percent\n\nConservatives: 43 percent\n\nRural dwellers: 35 percent\n\n\
      Whites without a college degree: 32 percent\n\nBaby Boomers and older: 31 percent\n\
      \nOn abortion and Planned Parenthood\n\nAnother key finding in the newly-released\
      \ data showed that support for abortion rights has hit a new high. Fifty-five\
      \ percent of Americans now say that abortion should be legal in all or most\
      \ cases, while 43 percent say that it should be illegal in all or most cases.\
      \ Also hitting a new high: The popularity of Planned Parenthood, which is now\
      \ rated positively by 52 percent of Americans, compared to 25 percent who rate\
      \ it negatively. (That\u2019s up from 45 percent positive/ 30 percent negative\
      \ in July 2015.)\n\nHere\u2019s a subtle but interesting disparity between those\
      \ two numbers, by the way, that provides some insight into how the politics\
      \ around funding for Planned Parenthood aren\u2019t the same as the politics\
      \ around abortion generally.\n\nOn the issue of whether abortion should be legal,\
      \ there\u2019s little daylight between whites and nonwhites (who favor legal\
      \ abortion in all or most cases by a net 11 and 13 percentage points, respectively.)\
      \ But when it comes to favorability for Planned Parenthood, nonwhites are significantly\
      \ more positive than whites. Nearly six-in-ten (59 percent) view the organization\
      \ positively, while just 13 percent view it negatively; among whites, it\u2019\
      s 49 percent positive, 30 percent negative.\n\nThe difference is even more stark\
      \ among those with lower levels of education. Among those with a high school\
      \ education or less, a majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say abortion should\
      \ be illegal in all or most cases, compared to 42 percent who say it should\
      \ be legal all or most cases. But in the same subgroup, Planned Parenthood has\
      \ a net positive rating by a big margin, with 48 percent viewing it positively\
      \ and just 25 percent viewing it negatively.\n\n\u201CThis is a reminder about\
      \ the role Planned Parenthood plays in providing health care services and who\
      \ those services are being directed towards,\u201D said Republican pollster\
      \ Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Fred\
      \ Yang.\n\nNew VA pick is getting pummeled on qualifications. That could be\
      \ tough to recover from\n\nThe first 36 hours for new Veterans Affairs nominee\
      \ Dr. Ronny Jackson have been, well, a little bumpy. Congressional Republicans\
      \ and veterans groups are being very cautious (at best) about his unexpected\
      \ selection. And most of the coverage has focused on how he would be walking\
      \ into a leadership position in the government\u2019s second-largest bureaucracy\
      \ without any meaningful management experience.\n\nControversies for incoming\
      \ nominees over policy, past statements or potential conflicts can be tricky\
      \ \u2014 but also surmountable for many candidates if they handle them the right\
      \ way. But skepticism over inexperience can be one of the hardest questions\
      \ to overcome. (Remember Harriet Miers?) We know that this president is loath\
      \ to change course, but if this level of criticism keeps up, it wouldn\u2019\
      t be shocking to start seeing some leaks about some second thoughts from the\
      \ West Wing.\n\nTrump to Putin: \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can\
      \ do that, but I'll win.\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s NBC\u2019s latest reporting on\
      \ how Trump has urged aides not to tout moves to crack down on Russia, from\
      \ NBC\u2019s Carol Lee, Courtney Kube and Kristen Welker: \u201CPresident Donald\
      \ Trump's national security advisers spent months trying to convince him to\
      \ sign off on a plan to supply new U.S. weapons to Ukraine to aid in the country's\
      \ fight against Russian-backed separatists, according to multiple senior administration\
      \ officials. Yet when the president finally authorized the major policy shift,\
      \ he told his aides not to publicly tout his decision, officials said. Doing\
      \ so, Trump argued, might agitate Russian President Vladimir Putin, according\
      \ to the officials\u2026.\n\n\"Officials said the increasingly puzzling divide\
      \ between Trump's policy decisions and public posture on Russia stems from his\
      \ continued hope for warmer relations with Putin and stubborn refusal to be\
      \ seen as appeasing the media or critics who question his silence or kind words\
      \ for the Russian leader.\u201D\n\nMore: \u201CBehind the scenes, however, Trump\
      \ has recently taken a sharper tone on Putin, administration officials said,\
      \ but the shift seems more a reaction to the Russian leader challenging the\
      \ president's strength than a new belief that he's an adversary. Putin's claim\
      \ earlier this month that Russia has new nuclear-capable weapons that could\
      \ hit the U.S., a threat he underscored with video simulating an attack, \"\
      really got under the president's skin,\" one official said\u2026 Two officials\
      \ said Trump told Putin during a phone call last week after Putin's re-election:\
      \ \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can do that, but I'll win.\u2019\
      \u201D\n\nRussia test-fires another missile after expelling dozens of U.S. diplomats\n\
      \nOf course, these Trump-Putin revelations come as Russia claims that it has\
      \ test-fired a missile of the type that Putin bragged about (when he \u201C\
      got under the president\u2019s skin.\u201D) \u2026 *And* as Russia is retaliating\
      \ for the expulsion of 60 of its diplomats from the United States by expelling\
      \ 60 American diplomats from its own country. \u2026 *And* as POLITICO is reporting\
      \ that Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has been pleading\
      \ with Sen. Orrin Hatch for help securing meetings with U.S. lawmakers and officials\
      \ who have refused or ignored his requests.\n\nOn the TODAY show, Antonov said\
      \ of the current tensions: \"It depends upon us to decide whether we are in\
      \ Cold War or not. But ... I don't remember such [a] bad shape of our relations.\u201D\
      \n\nSessions won\u2019t name a second special counsel to probe alleged FBI bias\n\
      \nEarlier this month, we noticed that some noteworthy members of Republican\
      \ leadership were joining the call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint\
      \ a special counsel to look at allegations of political bias in the FBI. Yesterday,\
      \ we got our answer from Sessions: No dice. (although he does say that the U.S.\
      \ attorney in Utah is also probing the issue, in addition to the DOJ inspector\
      \ general.)\n\nHere\u2019s more from NBC\u2019s Pete Williams: \u201CAppointing\
      \ a special counsel, Sessions said Thursday, is \"by design, reserved for use\
      \ in only the most extraordinary circumstances.\" He noted that since the special\
      \ counsel rules were established in 1999, they've been invoked only twice. In\
      \ the meantime, Sessions said, the Justice Department \u2018has successfully\
      \ investigated and prosecuted many high-profile, resource-intensive matters.\u2019\

    text: 'Lavrov said Russia would be applying the same response to other nations
      that also expelled Russian diplomats this week.


      "Based on the principle of reciprocity, in response, 58 employees of the US
      Embassy in Moscow and two employees of the U.S. Consulate General in Yekaterinburg
      were declared ''persona non grata'' for activities incompatible with diplomatic
      status," Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Ryabkov said in the
      statement.


      Ryabkov said the diplomats must leave by April 5 and that the consulate in Saint
      Petersburg must be closed by March 31.


      State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a press briefing that the
      U.S. would not rule out responding further to Russia''s latest action, signaling
      the possibility of a further escalation.


      "We reserve the right to respond," she said.


      On Monday, the U.S., the U.K., NATO and 25 other countries announced the expulsion
      of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of ex-Russian spy
      Sergei Skripal in British that was allegedly orchestrated by the Kremlin.


      The U.S. said it would dismiss 60 Russian diplomats identified by officials
      as intelligence officers, as well as close Russia''s Seattle consulate. Twelve
      of those to be expelled were from the Russian mission to the UN, while 48 were
      from other places throughout the U.S. The individuals have one week since the
      announcement to leave.


      In total, over two days, the U.S., U.K., NATO and the 27 other countries, including
      Georgia, previously part of the Soviet Union, expelled a total of 153 Russian
      diplomats in a show of solidarity with Britain.


      These steps, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on the condition
      of anonymity Monday, were intended to let the Russian government know that "when
      you attack our friends, you will face serious consequences."


      Removing these Russians, the official said, is also a bid to reduce the "unacceptably
      numerous" Russian intelligence officers who reside in the United States and
      spy on Americans.'

      \ to kick out? And does it have any impact?\n\nExperts consulted by NBC News\
      \ say the Russian diplomats who were expelled from the U.S. were really spies,\
      \ for the most part, and PNGing dozens of them is more than symbolic \u2014\
      \ it has an immediate, if short-term, effect on the ability of Russia to collect\

      \ British authorities immediately suspected the pair had been poisoned by Russian\
      \ agents trying to silence Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer who\
      \ had been a double agent.\n\nTwenty-six countries expelled more than 150 Russian\
      \ diplomats in response to the poisoning. According to current and former U.S.\
      \ officials, the Russians had violated one of the unwritten rules of espionage\
      \ \u2014 no assassinations, especially not on another country's soil.\n\nOne\
      \ current official said there is a gentlemen's agreement \u2014 \"honor among\
      \ thieves\" \u2014 in which there are lines spies should not cross. If a line\
      \ is crossed, the offended party can expel as PNGs those diplomats it thinks\

      \ in the 2016 U.S. election;\n\nPreparations for the outbreak of war;\n\nActs\
      \ of sabotage;\n\nStealing or trying to steal a nation's \"continuity of government\
      \ plans,\" i.e., how the top levels of government would react after a nuclear\
      \ strike. FBI mole Robert Hanssen gave the U.S. plans to the Russians, and the\
      \ U.S. expelled Russian diplomats after he was caught in 2001.\n\nThe phrase\
      \ itself, PNG, comes from the 1961 Vienna Convention, an international treaty\
      \ that defined rules for diplomatic relations. Article 9 of the treaty says\
      \ that \"without having to explain its decision,\" the host nation can notify\
      \ the \"sending State\" that \"any member of the diplomatic staff of the mission\
      \ is persona non grata.\"\n\nWhen the Russians summoned U.S. Ambassador Jon\
      \ Huntsman to the Foreign Ministry, they were notifying the \"sending State\"\
      \ that they planned to expel 60 Americans. When the Foreign Ministry announced\
      \ publicly that the Americans had been chosen for expulsion for \"activities\
      \ incompatible with diplomatic status,\" they were calling them spies without\
      \ giving details.\n\nOnce declared persona non grata,a diplomat must leave the\
      \ country \"within a reasonable period\" or risk losing diplomatic immunity.\n\
      \nRussian consulate in Seattle. Lindsey Wasson / Reuters\n\nThe U.S. expulsion\
      \ of 60 diplomats in March was the second such purge in less than 18 months.\
      \ The Obama administration had PNGed 35 diplomats in late 2016 in retaliation\
      \ for Russian cyber meddling in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nAccording\
      \ to the current and former U.S. officials, in both cases the FBI and CIA had\
      \ previously identified the operatives and gave the list to policy makers, who\
      \ made the final decisions. Many of the Russians who fill diplomatic positions\
      \ in the U.S. are actually operatives working for the country's various intelligence\
      \ services.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said\
      \ that the U.S. gave Russia the names of the PNGed individuals after an interagency\
      \ process that included the \"weigh-in\" of many \"U.S. government partners,\"\
      \ like the FBI.\n\n\"We believe our country is safer by making these Russians\
      \ go home,\" said Nauert. \"We know that they were not here to do good, but\

    text: 'The court reasoned at that time that mail-order business was minor compared
      to in-store sales and that catalog retailers would be saddled with too much
      of a burden in having to figure out the correct sales tax, given that taxes
      differ among the states and even among cities within a given state.


      In 1992 and 2015 the court revisited the issue and declined to let states tax
      Internet sales.


      South Dakota, concluding that the business world had radically changed, decided
      to force the issue and passed a law in 2016 requiring Internet retailers to
      collect taxes if they pass a minimum threshold in sales to the state''s residents.


      "Times have changed," the state says in its Supreme Court filing. "Amazon did
      not begin selling books out of Jeff Bezos''s garage until July 1995."


      As for the rule that only companies with physical presence in a state can be
      required to collect taxes, South Dakota says Internet retailers are far more
      present in the lives of state residents than many big-box stores.


      "The Internet now makes it possible for out-of-state sellers to reach consumers
      with engaging, interactive virtual storefronts in our homes or on our smart
      phones at any hour of the day."


      Backed by 36 other states, South Dakota says local governments lose nearly $34
      billion a year in tax revenue because of the physical presence rule.


      South Dakota also says the notion that the nation''s roughly 12,000 different
      state and local tax rates present a burden to Internet retailers is equally
      outdated. Computer programs can instantly calculate the correct tax rate based
      simply on a customer''s address.


      Internet companies that sued to block the South Dakota law, including Overstock.com
      and Wayfair, argue that while the business world has changed, collecting and
      distributing sales taxes remains a burden.


      "The truth is that sales tax collection has become more complex as the number
      of tax jurisdictions has more than doubled since 1992. Moreover, the integration
      of tax collection software is extraordinarily expensive," the companies say
      in their Supreme Court brief.


      NetChoice, a trade association of Internet retailers, says the tax requirement
      would hurt small Internet companies, forcing them to comply with "overbearing
      tax compliance burdens."


      The Trump administration is siding with South Dakota. None of the Supreme Court''s
      earlier decisions "could have foreseen the rise of modern e-commerce," says
      Solicitor General Noel Francisco.'

    text: "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The\
      \ news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nWASHINGTON\
      \ \u2014 The New York Times first reported yesterday that Trump lawyer John\
      \ Dowd floated the possibility of pardons for Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort\
      \ last year, just as special counsel Robert Mueller was investigating the two\
      \ men. The discussions with Flynn and Manafort\u2019s lawyers (which Dowd denies)\
      \ open up a host of new questions about why a Trump lawyer was raising the possibility\
      \ of pardons for individuals who were facing the choice of granting or denying\
      \ cooperation with the probe.\n\nHere are six new questions the story raises\
      \ about Manafort, Flynn and the potential for pardons:\n\n1) Was Dowd acting\
      \ on his own? Or was he speaking for the president? The president is the only\
      \ person who can grant a pardon for federal crimes, so in a more typical presidency,\
      \ it would seem obvious that discussions about pardons would be done with the\
      \ president\u2019s knowledge. But one can also argue that Trump is no regular\
      \ president, and his management style does seem to allow for some freelancing\
      \ from his trusted staff.\n\n2) Why was Dowd the one asking rather than Don\
      \ McGahn? \u2014 Dowd, who resigned last week, was Trump\u2019s personal lawyer,\
      \ not the White House counsel. (That\u2019s Don McGahn.) So why did a personal\
      \ attorney, not the official White House legal mind, have discussions on a power\
      \ that resides firmly in Trump\u2019s role as president, not as a citizen?\n\
      \n3) Does this explain why Manafort isn\u2019t making a deal? Legal experts\
      \ have been scratching their heads about why Manafort hasn\u2019t agreed to\
      \ cooperate with the probe, considering the severity of the charges against\
      \ him. We don\u2019t know if Manafort is holding out for a pardon, but the idea\
      \ that it was floated to his attorney would give some credence to the idea.\n\
      \n4) And if it DOES explain why Manafort didn\u2019t take a deal, why did Flynn\
      \ agree to cooperate? Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller in early December,\
      \ saying that he \u201Cis working to set things right.\u201D If both he and\
      \ Manafort knew that a pardon was on the table, why did they choose different\
      \ paths when it came to cooperation with Mueller? Could it be the cost of an\
      \ extended legal battle, concern that Trump wouldn\u2019t follow through on\
      \ a promise, or something else entirely?\n\n5) Would a federal pardon even be\
      \ enough? Manafort is accused of offenses \u2014 including financial crimes\
      \ \u2014 that are also crimes under state law. But a presidential pardon doesn\u2019\
      t cover charges from state and local authorities. We know that investigators\
      \ in New York have also been probing Manafort\u2019s business dealings, and\
      \ Trump\u2019s pardon wouldn\u2019t apply if state authorities ultimately prosecuted\
      \ the former campaign chairman.\n\n6) Was the White House concerned about what\
      \ Manafort or Flynn would say to the special counsel? This is really the crux\
      \ of the story, and we simply don\u2019t know. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee\
      \ Sanders said in response to this exact question that \u201Cthere was no collusion\
      \ and we\u2019re very confident in that and look forward to this process wrapping\
      \ up.\u201D But if there\u2019s one thing every development in this story underscores\
      \ again and again, it\u2019s that the \u201Cwrapping up\u201D doesn\u2019t seem\
      \ to be happening anytime soon."

      \ as American motorists begin switching from smaller, fuel-efficient sedans\
      \ and hybrids to more gas-hungry SUVs and pickups.\n\nNot all automakers support\
      \ a rollback, however, and the debate has led to an unusual split between manufacturers\
      \ and key auto suppliers who support the 54.5 mpg target, according to a new\
      \ study by CALSTART, a California-based consortium aimed at developing clean\
      \ transportation technologies.\n\n\u201CWe found that suppliers strongly support\

      \ for 2025) was feasible and do-able.\u201D\n\nUnder the Obama administration,\
      \ the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards were raised twice after\

      \ range.\n\nMost experts agree that figure is possible, but the question is\
      \ at what cost \u2014 and with what impact. The general consensus is that the\
      \ standard will require a sharp increase in the use of electrified powertrain\
      \ technologies, including conventional hybrids, plug-ins, and battery-electric\
      \ vehicles, or BEVs. A 2010 study by the Center for Automotive Research, in\

      \ being negotiated. And a study released by the Boston Consulting Group last\
      \ December forecast that by the time the 54.5 mpg target goes into effect the\
      \ cost of owning and operating an all-electric vehicle would be roughly comparable\
      \ to a conventional gas model.\n\nIronically, even as automakers have pushed\
      \ for a rollback, they have radically ramped up their electrification programs.\
      \ GM plans to have around two dozen BEVs in its showrooms by mid-decade. Volkswagen\
      \ will launch 50 by the same time. Volvo says every model it sells will use\
      \ some form of electrification, a target several other marques, including Infiniti,\
      \ have also laid out. Nissan announced plans last week to add an assortment\
      \ of its own pure electric models, and Carlos Ghosn, CEO of the Renault Nissan\
      \ Alliance, said in an interview last autumn that the Japanese side of the group\
      \ will not back off of its mileage commitment no matter what the EPA decides.\n\
      \nThe administration could completely gut the program, says one expert. The\

      \ \u2014 Republicans are running attack ads blasting Hillary Clinton as an out-of-touch\
      \ elitist. Fox News prime time is blanketed with reports about Clinton investigations.\
      \ Trump 2020 campaign rallies in key presidential swing states feature \"lock\

      \ The GOP has gone negative on Clinton for more than 25 years \u2014 and they\
      \ don't think her absence from the ballot is reason enough to stop now.\n\n\
      So far, at least three Republican candidates or groups have released ads over\
      \ the past week slamming Clinton, in what amounts to an early midterms election-year\
      \ beta test of her continued utility in firing up the conservative base.\n\n\
      A new spot for Rep. Evan Jenkins, one of the Republicans challenging Democrat\
      \ Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, opens with recent comments Clinton made\
      \ at a conference halfway around the world. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign,\
      \ she said last month in Mumbai, India, was all about looking \"backwards,\"\
      \ while she won big cities and other places that are \"optimistic, diverse,\
      \ dynamic, moving forward.\"\n\nIt was a line guaranteed to strike a sour note\
      \ in West Virginia, which voted for Trump over Clinton by more than 40 points.\n\
      \nHillary Clinton accepting the presidential nomination at the Democratic National\
      \ Convention in Philadelphia on July 28, 2016. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters file\n\
      \n\"It's Hillary who's got it backwards,\" Jenkins says in the ad as undated\
      \ images of urban riots flash on screen. \"The big cities she won are the places\
      \ flooding our state with heroin \u2014 where lawlessness, looting and liberalism\
      \ rule.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is running\
      \ against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, is airing an ad that shows a long\
      \ clip of Clinton's \"backwards\" comments before concluding, \"This is what\
      \ Claire McCaskill and her 'president' think of you.\"\n\nAnd a new digital\
      \ ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee opens by telling viewers\
      \ Clinton \"called you deplorable,\" adding that \"Florida won't forget\" Sen.\
      \ Bill Nelson's 2016 endorsement of her White House bid. It's one of several\
      \ state-specific spots being released by the GOP's Senate campaign arm that\
      \ ties vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents to their party's most recent\
      \ presidential nominee.\n\nRick Wilson, a Florida-based Republican strategist\
      \ and ad-maker, said the GOP's strategic bet is that shifting the focus back\
      \ to Clinton \"lets Republicans and Donald Trump pretend like the 2016 campaign\
      \ is still going on.\"\n\n\"If I were advising Hillary Clinton,\" he added,\
      \ \"I would raise a gigantic s--- ton of money for people and stay out of the\
      \ news.\"\n\nWhatever Clinton does, that's unlikely to happen in at least one\
      \ corner of the media: Conservative news outlets have never stopped covering\
      \ her with election-year intensity.\n\nSome 17 months after Election Day 2016,\
      \ Fox News is still devotes roughly equal time to Trump and Clinton, according\
      \ to an analysis by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters \u2014 despite\
      \ the fact that one is now a private citizen, and the other president of the\
      \ United States.\n\nRed-state Democrats run for cover\n\nDemocratic campaign\
      \ officials say the GOP's throw-back message reflects the lack of an effective\
      \ new one in what promises to be a tough year for Republicans.\n\nBut candidates\
      \ on the receiving end of the Clinton attacks aren't dismissing their potential\
      \ potency. Some are laying low, avoiding the issue entirely: Of half a dozen\
      \ red state Senate Democrats asked to comment for this article, only one responded\
      \ for the record.\n\nThat lawmaker, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, a Trump-state\
      \ Democrat facing a bumpy road to re-election, replied to NBC's question about\
      \ what he thought Clinton's 2018 role should be with a statement that didn't\
      \ mention her and said the midterms weren't about \"rehashing the tired political\
      \ arguments of past elections.\"\n\nNelson, who's expected to face Florida GOP\
      \ Gov. Rick Scott in November, avoided giving The Tampa Bay Times a direct response\
      \ about whether he would campaign with Clinton. \"I'm not going to answer that,\"\
      \ he told the paper. \"Obviously when she was a candidate, I campaigned with\
      \ her. That's like you asking me, 'Would I campaign with Robert Redford?' ...\
      \ We'll take that up when we get there.\""

    text: 'But while officials in the West Wing are reviewing the seriousness of the
      questions around Pruitt, it was too soon to know if the EPA secretary would
      face harsh internal questioning or draw the ire of President Donald Trump, according
      to a White House official not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.


      A Republican who previously served as the state attorney general of Oklahoma,
      Pruitt has long been a champion of the oil and gas industry. In the year he
      has served as the Trump administration''s top environmental official, Pruitt
      has moved to scrap, gut or replace numerous environmental regulations opposed
      by the industry while boosting the continued burning of fossil fuels, which
      is the primary cause of climate change.


      In December, Pruitt and members of his staff spent about $40,000 in taxpayer
      funds to fly to Morocco to help encourage the North African kingdom to import
      liquefied natural gas from the United States. Cheniere, the lobbying client
      of Hart''s firm, is currently the only exporter of liquefied natural gas from
      the continental United States.


      In a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday, Hart said Pruitt is a casual
      friend from Oklahoma who moved into the building in early 2017. Hart said he
      had no contact with Pruitt for many months, other than a brief exchange at the
      National Prayer Breakfast in February.


      "Pruitt signed a market based, short-term lease for a condo owned partially
      by my wife," Hart said, according to a statement released by his firm. "Pruitt
      paid all rent owed as agreed to in the lease. My wife does not, and has not
      ever lobbied the EPA on any matters."


      Hart''s wife, Vicki Hart, is also a lobbyist, focusing on health care issues.


      EPA''s press office also did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday
      or Friday about Pruitt''s Washington living arrangements.


      The $50 a night rate Pruitt paid is significantly less than advertised rates
      for rentals in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where the unit is located. One
      bedroom apartments listed for rent in the immediate area on Friday ranged between
      $1,600 and $2,500 a month, depending on amenities. Single rooms listed online
      for one-night rentals averaged about $120 a night.


      Pruitt has been under increasing scrutiny for this frequent taxpayer-funded
      travel, which has included first-class airline tickets. Though federal regulations
      typically require federal officials to fly in coach, the EPA chief has said
      he needed to sit in premium seats due to security concerns.


      After a series of recent media reports about questionable spending, Pruitt was
      one four high-ranking Trump officials who met separately with White House Cabinet
      Secretary William McGinley to discuss proper ethics practices.


      The president is still said to be fond of Pruitt and has applauded the EPA secretary
      for his attention-grabbing dust-ups with environmentalist groups, according
      to the White House official and an outside Trump adviser.


      Both a House oversight committee and the EPA''s inspector general are now reviewing
      Pruitt''s travel spending. Jeffrey Lagda, a spokesman for EPA''s internal watchdog,
      said Friday that the office has been "made aware of the allegations related
      to Administrator Pruitt''s living arrangements last year."


      Pruitt''s EPA travel has also often included weekend-long layovers at his home
      in Tulsa. The EPA chief is widely mentioned in Oklahoma as a possible successor
      to Sen. James Inhofe, the state''s octogenarian GOP senator who is expected
      to retire at the end of his current term.


      Among the clients at Hart''s lobbying firm is OGE Energy Corp., an electricity
      company serving Oklahoma and Arkansas. According to federal disclosure reports,
      the company paid Williams and Jensen $400,000 in 2017 to lobby on issues that
      included EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.


      Copies of Pruitt''s daily calendar obtained by the AP through a public records
      request show that Pruitt held a March 2017 meeting in his EPA office with OGE
      Chairman and CEO Sean Trauschke and company vice president Paul Renfrow. The
      meeting was arranged at the request of George Baker, a registered lobbyist from
      Hart''s firm, who also attended.


      In October, EPA announced it would rewrite the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era
      regulation that sought to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired
      power plants like those operated by OGE. EPA has also moved to scrap regulations
      cutting power plant emissions of such toxic substances as mercury, as well as
      tighter standards on dumps containing coal ash.


      Records show Pruitt has had a long relationship with OGE. Campaign finance reports
      from Oklahoma show more than three dozen OGE executives donated to Pruitt''s
      2014 re-election campaign for state attorney general, even though he was running
      without a Democratic opponent. OGE chairman Peter Delaney contributed $3,500,
      while Trauschke kicked in $2,500 and Renfrow contributed $1,000.


      Environmental groups pointed to news of Pruitt''s living arrangements as further
      evidence he caters to polluters, and they renewed their calls for him to resign.


      "Scott Pruitt got a sweetheart deal on a D.C. condo directly from a fossil fuel
      lobbyist, then wasted thousands in taxpayer dollars pushing that lobbyist''s
      agenda on a trip to Morocco," said Michael Brune, the executive director of
      the Sierra Club. "This deal stinks like the swamp Scott Pruitt is mired in."'

      \ congressional seat Democrats gained from it.\n\n\"Our country and our democracy\

      \ (The latest debates over the Census question on citizenship, the transgender\
      \ military ban, the Laura Ingraham vs. David Hogg conflict and even the popularity\
      \ of the \"Roseanne\" reboot are just a handful of recent reminders.)\n\nAnd\
      \ the continuing divide over a changing American culture shows why the wars\
      \ continue to rage. In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 54 percent\
      \ of Americans said that they are comfortable with American society becoming\
      \ more diverse and tolerant of different lifestyles, gender roles, languages\
      \ and other experiences, while 25 percent said that the changes make them uneasy.\n\
      \nBut the geographic, generational and \u2014 yes \u2014 partisan differences\
      \ over the changing culture also show us some of the broad outlines of the two\
      \ party coalitions.\n\nHere's a closer look at who's comfortable and who's uneasy\
      \ with a changing culture.\n\nMost comfortable\n\nClinton voters: 80 percent\n\
      \nLiberals: 80 percent\n\nPrefer a Democratic Congress in November: 77 percent\n\
      \nDemocrats: 74 percent\n\nWhites with a college degree: 64 percent\n\nMillennials:\
      \ 64 percent\n\nUrban dwellers: 62 percent\n\nMost uneasy\n\nPrefer a Republican\
      \ Congress in November: 45 percent\n\nTrump voters: 44 percent\n\nRepublicans:\
      \ 43 percent\n\nConservatives: 43 percent\n\nRural dwellers: 35 percent\n\n\
      Whites without a college degree: 32 percent\n\nBaby Boomers and older: 31 percent\n\
      \nOn abortion and Planned Parenthood\n\nAnother key finding in the newly-released\
      \ data showed that support for abortion rights has hit a new high. Fifty-five\
      \ percent of Americans now say that abortion should be legal in all or most\
      \ cases, while 43 percent say that it should be illegal in all or most cases.\
      \ Also hitting a new high: The popularity of Planned Parenthood, which is now\
      \ rated positively by 52 percent of Americans, compared to 25 percent who rate\
      \ it negatively. (That\u2019s up from 45 percent positive/ 30 percent negative\
      \ in July 2015.)\n\nHere\u2019s a subtle but interesting disparity between those\
      \ two numbers, by the way, that provides some insight into how the politics\
      \ around funding for Planned Parenthood aren\u2019t the same as the politics\
      \ around abortion generally.\n\nOn the issue of whether abortion should be legal,\
      \ there\u2019s little daylight between whites and nonwhites (who favor legal\
      \ abortion in all or most cases by a net 11 and 13 percentage points, respectively.)\
      \ But when it comes to favorability for Planned Parenthood, nonwhites are significantly\
      \ more positive than whites. Nearly six-in-ten (59 percent) view the organization\
      \ positively, while just 13 percent view it negatively; among whites, it\u2019\
      s 49 percent positive, 30 percent negative.\n\nThe difference is even more stark\
      \ among those with lower levels of education. Among those with a high school\
      \ education or less, a majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say abortion should\
      \ be illegal in all or most cases, compared to 42 percent who say it should\
      \ be legal all or most cases. But in the same subgroup, Planned Parenthood has\
      \ a net positive rating by a big margin, with 48 percent viewing it positively\
      \ and just 25 percent viewing it negatively.\n\n\u201CThis is a reminder about\
      \ the role Planned Parenthood plays in providing health care services and who\
      \ those services are being directed towards,\u201D said Republican pollster\
      \ Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Fred\
      \ Yang.\n\nNew VA pick is getting pummeled on qualifications. That could be\
      \ tough to recover from\n\nThe first 36 hours for new Veterans Affairs nominee\
      \ Dr. Ronny Jackson have been, well, a little bumpy. Congressional Republicans\
      \ and veterans groups are being very cautious (at best) about his unexpected\
      \ selection. And most of the coverage has focused on how he would be walking\
      \ into a leadership position in the government\u2019s second-largest bureaucracy\
      \ without any meaningful management experience.\n\nControversies for incoming\
      \ nominees over policy, past statements or potential conflicts can be tricky\
      \ \u2014 but also surmountable for many candidates if they handle them the right\
      \ way. But skepticism over inexperience can be one of the hardest questions\
      \ to overcome. (Remember Harriet Miers?) We know that this president is loath\
      \ to change course, but if this level of criticism keeps up, it wouldn\u2019\
      t be shocking to start seeing some leaks about some second thoughts from the\
      \ West Wing.\n\nTrump to Putin: \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can\
      \ do that, but I'll win.\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s NBC\u2019s latest reporting on\
      \ how Trump has urged aides not to tout moves to crack down on Russia, from\
      \ NBC\u2019s Carol Lee, Courtney Kube and Kristen Welker: \u201CPresident Donald\
      \ Trump's national security advisers spent months trying to convince him to\
      \ sign off on a plan to supply new U.S. weapons to Ukraine to aid in the country's\
      \ fight against Russian-backed separatists, according to multiple senior administration\
      \ officials. Yet when the president finally authorized the major policy shift,\
      \ he told his aides not to publicly tout his decision, officials said. Doing\
      \ so, Trump argued, might agitate Russian President Vladimir Putin, according\
      \ to the officials\u2026.\n\n\"Officials said the increasingly puzzling divide\
      \ between Trump's policy decisions and public posture on Russia stems from his\
      \ continued hope for warmer relations with Putin and stubborn refusal to be\
      \ seen as appeasing the media or critics who question his silence or kind words\
      \ for the Russian leader.\u201D\n\nMore: \u201CBehind the scenes, however, Trump\
      \ has recently taken a sharper tone on Putin, administration officials said,\
      \ but the shift seems more a reaction to the Russian leader challenging the\
      \ president's strength than a new belief that he's an adversary. Putin's claim\
      \ earlier this month that Russia has new nuclear-capable weapons that could\
      \ hit the U.S., a threat he underscored with video simulating an attack, \"\
      really got under the president's skin,\" one official said\u2026 Two officials\
      \ said Trump told Putin during a phone call last week after Putin's re-election:\
      \ \u2018If you want to have an arms race we can do that, but I'll win.\u2019\
      \u201D\n\nRussia test-fires another missile after expelling dozens of U.S. diplomats\n\
      \nOf course, these Trump-Putin revelations come as Russia claims that it has\
      \ test-fired a missile of the type that Putin bragged about (when he \u201C\
      got under the president\u2019s skin.\u201D) \u2026 *And* as Russia is retaliating\
      \ for the expulsion of 60 of its diplomats from the United States by expelling\
      \ 60 American diplomats from its own country. \u2026 *And* as POLITICO is reporting\
      \ that Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has been pleading\
      \ with Sen. Orrin Hatch for help securing meetings with U.S. lawmakers and officials\
      \ who have refused or ignored his requests.\n\nOn the TODAY show, Antonov said\
      \ of the current tensions: \"It depends upon us to decide whether we are in\
      \ Cold War or not. But ... I don't remember such [a] bad shape of our relations.\u201D\
      \n\nSessions won\u2019t name a second special counsel to probe alleged FBI bias\n\
      \nEarlier this month, we noticed that some noteworthy members of Republican\
      \ leadership were joining the call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint\
      \ a special counsel to look at allegations of political bias in the FBI. Yesterday,\
      \ we got our answer from Sessions: No dice. (although he does say that the U.S.\
      \ attorney in Utah is also probing the issue, in addition to the DOJ inspector\
      \ general.)\n\nHere\u2019s more from NBC\u2019s Pete Williams: \u201CAppointing\
      \ a special counsel, Sessions said Thursday, is \"by design, reserved for use\
      \ in only the most extraordinary circumstances.\" He noted that since the special\
      \ counsel rules were established in 1999, they've been invoked only twice. In\
      \ the meantime, Sessions said, the Justice Department \u2018has successfully\
      \ investigated and prosecuted many high-profile, resource-intensive matters.\u2019\

      "Based on the principle of reciprocity, in response, 58 employees of the US

      were declared ''persona non grata'' for activities incompatible with diplomatic
      status," Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Ryabkov said in the
      statement.


      Ryabkov said the diplomats must leave by April 5 and that the consulate in Saint
      Petersburg must be closed by March 31.


      State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a press briefing that the
      U.S. would not rule out responding further to Russia''s latest action, signaling
      the possibility of a further escalation.


      "We reserve the right to respond," she said.


      On Monday, the U.S., the U.K., NATO and 25 other countries announced the expulsion
      of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of ex-Russian spy
      Sergei Skripal in British that was allegedly orchestrated by the Kremlin.


      The U.S. said it would dismiss 60 Russian diplomats identified by officials
      as intelligence officers, as well as close Russia''s Seattle consulate. Twelve
      of those to be expelled were from the Russian mission to the UN, while 48 were
      from other places throughout the U.S. The individuals have one week since the
      announcement to leave.


      In total, over two days, the U.S., U.K., NATO and the 27 other countries, including
      Georgia, previously part of the Soviet Union, expelled a total of 153 Russian
      diplomats in a show of solidarity with Britain.


      These steps, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on the condition
      of anonymity Monday, were intended to let the Russian government know that "when
      you attack our friends, you will face serious consequences."


      Removing these Russians, the official said, is also a bid to reduce the "unacceptably
      numerous" Russian intelligence officers who reside in the United States and
      spy on Americans.'

      \ to the current and former U.S. officials, in both cases the FBI and CIA had\
      \ previously identified the operatives and gave the list to policy makers, who\
      \ made the final decisions. Many of the Russians who fill diplomatic positions\
      \ in the U.S. are actually operatives working for the country's various intelligence\
      \ services.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said\

      \ process that included the \"weigh-in\" of many \"U.S. government partners,\"\
      \ like the FBI.\n\n\"We believe our country is safer by making these Russians\

      Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized special counsel Robert Mueller
      to investigate whether former Trump presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort
      colluded with the Russian government to affect the outcome of the 2016 election,
      according to a newly released classified memo.


      The partially redacted Aug. 2, 2017, memo from Rosenstein to Mueller, released
      Monday night as part of a broader court filing, includes specific details regarding
      the scope of Mueller''s investigation, including allegations that Manafort committed
      "a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect
      to the Russian government''s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for
      president of the United States, in violation of United States law."


      The memo from Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller''s investigation, appears
      to be the first publicly released evidence showing that Mueller has been authorized
      to specifically investigate collusion during the presidential race between the
      Russians and top members of Donald Trump''s campaign.'

    text: 'Just minutes earlier, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition
      to Defeat ISIS, Brett McGurk, stressed that the job was not finished.


      "We are in Syria to fight ISIS. That is our mission," McGurk said, standing
      alongside U.S. Army Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of the U.S. Central Command,
      at the U.S. Institute of Peace. "Our mission is not over. And we are going to
      complete that mission."


      Trump did not contradict the sentiment, telling reporters Tuesday, "We will
      not rest until ISIS is gone."


      But the mixed messages from the administration have made the timeline for any
      U.S. withdrawal unclear.


      U.S. and coalition partners on the ground have taken control of almost 95 percent
      of the territory in Syria once held by ISIS but U.S. officials have said their
      remaining presence will prove difficult to eliminate quickly and could take
      months.


      Trump said Tuesday that he believed the U.S. had almost completed the task and
      the military''s success on the ground was close to 100 percent.


      For his part, Votel stressed the importance of stabilization in Syria, and said
      the U.S. military can help.


      "The hard part, I think, is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas,
      consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes," Votel said.


      U.S. officials have confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that a hold has been
      placed on $200 million pledged by the U.S. for those stabilization efforts in
      Syria. McGurk said Tuesday that the funds were under review but stressed that
      U.S. efforts to clear land mines, remove rubble and restore basic services such
      as electricity and running water would continue.


      "It is not hampering our work in the field," he said. "Our diplomats and our
      development experts from State and USAID have plenty of work to do, and they
      also have enough resources to continue with that work."'

    text: 'Judge Amy Berman Jackson said van der Zwaan''s false statements were not
      an incidental mistake but a knowing lie during an investigation of international
      importance. She said she took into account that he is an attorney and should
      have known better.


      Jackson said the sentence was intended to "reflect the seriousness of the offense,
      promote respect for the law" and reduce sentencing disparities.


      "This is not something that happened to him. This is something he did," she
      said. "He put is personal interests ahead of the interests of justice."


      William Schwartz, a lawyer for van der Zwaan, urged the judge not to sentence
      him to prison time so he could return to London where his wife is in the midst
      of a difficult pregnancy and expecting their first child in August.


      Prosecutors said van der Zwaan had lied to federal agents and covered it up,
      trying to destroy emails. They had asked that he be sentenced to some time behind
      bars as a "general deterrent" but did not make a specific recommendation on
      length.


      The van der Zwaan case did not involve Mueller''s central mission of examining
      potential help for Russian election meddling in 2016. Instead, it grew out of
      the investigation of Gates and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort over
      work they did in Ukraine more than a decade ago.


      Prosecuting van der Zwaan was more likely intended to send a message that Mueller''s
      team would move aggressively against anyone who tried to obstruct their investigation
      rather than to enlist van der Zwaan''s help. The terms of his plea do not require
      him to cooperate with prosecutors.


      Ty Cobb, President Donald Trump''s lawyer who handles the Russia matter, declined
      Tuesday to comment on the van der Zwaan sentencing.


      As a lawyer in an international law firm, van der Zwaan worked with Gates and
      Manafort for a Ukrainian political party closely aligned with Russia. The law
      firm, Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom, was hired by the government of former Ukrainian
      President Viktor Yanukovych in 2012 to examine the prosecution of one of his
      former political rivals.


      The firm''s work was supposed to be independent of the lobbying by Manafort
      and Gates, but van der Zwaan leaked a copy of the report and talking points
      to Gates and lied about later conversations in 2016 with Gates about how the
      firm was paid and potential criminal charges against the firm in Ukraine.


      Mueller''s team has separately charged Gates and Manafort with illegally hiding
      millions of dollars they earned doing work in Ukraine. Gates has pleaded guilty
      but no sentencing date has been set; Manafort faces trial in early July.


      Van der Zwaan''s lawyers had noted that two weeks after making the false statements,
      he returned to the U.S. to meet with Mueller''s team again to correct the record.
      When he had lied the first time, they said, he was not trying to impede the
      investigation but instead wanted to prevent his law firm from discovering he
      had misled his supervisors about his contact with Gates.


      Before pronouncing sentence, Jackson said van der Zwaan''s "expressions of remorse
      were muted," noting that while some members of his family wrote to the judge
      to urge leniency, he did not. Nor, the judge said, did he make any effort to
      preform community service while in the U.S. awaiting sentencing.


      Van der Zwaan''s father-in-law, German Khan, is a prominent Russian billionaire.'

      Last week, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero ruled that a request by Daniels

      that she arbitrate her claims.


      Avenatti has argued that the non-disclosure agreement is invalid because Trump
      never signed it. But in Monday''s filing Blakely responded that the language
      of the agreement did not specify that Trump, using the pseudonym David Dennison,
      needed to sign it for the agreement to be binding.


      Blakely also argued that Daniels accepted the $130,000 and did not dispute the

      \nWhat happens if and when they reach the U.S. border?\n\nIf the caravan attempts\

    text: 'James McHenry, director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review,
      used similar language in an email Friday that details the new measures for the
      department''s approximately 350 immigration judges.


      "Using metrics to evaluate performance is neither novel nor unique to (the Executive
      Office for Immigration Review)," McHenry wrote. "The purpose of implementing
      these metrics is to encourage efficient and effective case management while
      preserving immigration judge discretion and due process."


      The Associated Press obtained a copy of McHenry''s memo and performance plan,
      whose contents were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.


      The measures are highly specific. A judge who completes more than 560 cases
      a year but fewer than 700 "needs improvement." Deciding fewer than 560 cases
      a year is deemed unsatisfactory.


      The Justice Department said Monday that judges complete an average of 678 cases
      a year.


      Under one benchmark, judges must rule the same day on every plea by asylum seekers
      to pass an initial threshold of establishing "credible" or "reasonable" fear
      to earn a satisfactory mark, unless the Homeland Security Department is responsible
      for them failing to show. Anything less than 80 percent is considered unsatisfactory.


      The National Immigration Judges Association, whose recent collective bargaining
      agreement allows for performance metrics, strongly opposes the numerical targets
      and will explore options under federal labor law, said Dana Leigh Marks, a union
      spokeswoman.


      "We believe the imposition of numerical performance metrics is completely, utterly
      contrary to judicial independence," said Marks, who is also an immigration judge
      in San Francisco. "We believe assessing quality is fine, not quantity."


      Judges can argue that the nature of their cases justifies a lower completion
      rate, but Marks said keeping logs will add to their work burden and potentially
      create more backlog. She also said people may be more inclined to appeal decisions
      by arguing that the quotas denied them a fair hearing.


      Laura Lynch, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association,
      said immigration attorneys were deeply concerned that cases will be "rushed
      through."


      "Subjecting judges to numerical goals undermines one of the core principles
      of our judicial system, which is really a fair day in court," she said.'

      to be very rainy and nasty and cold and windy," said Trump, bundled up in an
      overcoat. "And look what we have: perfect weather. Perfect weather. Beautiful
      weather."


      He thanked his wife for doing an "incredible job" on the event. He also praised
      the economy and a recent increase in funding for the military.


      "This is a special year. Our country is doing great. You look at the economy;
      you look at what''s happening," Trump said. "Nothing is ever easy, but we have
      never had an economy like we have right now. And we''re going to make it bigger
      and better and stronger."


      Trump and the first lady also joined kids at a station where they made greeting
      cards for U.S. troops. Trump returned to the White House afterward.


      The Easter Egg Roll was also a Trump family affair with most of the president''s
      five children and nine grandchildren in attendance, including Donald Trump Jr.,
      his wife, Vanessa, and their five kids; son Eric, his wife, Lara, and their
      baby; daughter Tiffany; and son Barron.


      White House chief of staff John Kelly, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and legislative
      affairs director Marc Short were among the administration officials seen hand-in-hand
      with their children or grandchildren.


      In all, the White House said it expected nearly 30,000 adults and children to
      stream through the gates for the all-day event. Thousands of volunteers worked
      during the weekend to help set things up, as well as on Monday to help keep
      the lines moving.


      The first lady announced last week that she had added lawn bowling to the roster
      of festivities that included a reading nook, egg hunts and cookie decorating.
      She spent several minutes watching as kids took turns rolling a large bouncy
      ball into inflated bowling pins.


      "We have a beautiful day, a little bit cold," Mrs. Trump said later as she prepared
      to read a copy of the children''s book, "YOU!," by Sandra Magsamen. The book
      encourages youngsters to believe in themselves and to not be afraid to make
      a mistake.


      The White House Easter Egg Roll dates to 1878.'

      \ networks do not control the content that appears on Sinclair-owned affiliates.\n\
      \nIt was not immediately clear how many Sinclair stations aired a version of\
      \ the script.\n\nIn a memo sent to Sinclair employees and obtained by NBC News,\
      \ Scott Livingston, senior vice president of news at Sinclair, responded to\
      \ criticism of the company in relation to the Deadspin video.\n\n\"The critics\
      \ are now upset about our well-researched journalistic initiative focused on\
      \ fair and objective reporting,\" Livingston wrote. \"For the record, the stories\
      \ we are referencing in this campaign are the unsubstantiated ones (i.e. fake/false)\
      \ like 'Pope Endorses Trump' which move quickly across social media and result\
      \ in an ill-informed public. Some other false stories, like the false 'Pizzagate'\
      \ story, can result in dangerous consequences.\"\n\nLivingston referenced a\
      \ Monmouth University poll released Monday. The poll found that three in four\

      \n\n\"This poll underscores the importance of our journalistic responsibility\
      \ effort. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of accuracy and fact checking,\"\
      \ Livingston wrote.\n\nPerceived bias in media coverage has been under scrutiny\

      The Tribune deal was announced after new FCC regulations went through in April\

    text: 'This time, it appears the president''s own aides and key State Department
      officials also were blindsided by Trump''s suggestion that he and Putin could
      possibly meet at the White House. In fact, when Trump first revealed he had
      suggested getting together with Putin "in the not-too-distant future" in answer
      to a question at a photo opportunity on March 20, his aides quickly suggested
      nothing was planned before the two leaders would both be attending the G-20
      summit in Argentina in November.


      It would also be another example of Trump ignoring his talking points, which
      specifically advised him in all caps, "DO NOT CONGRATULATE" Putin for his sham
      election victory when they spoke by phone March 20. Trump did so anyway. National
      Security Council staff members routinely record and listen in on such calls
      with foreign leaders. So they would have been aware that Trump had floated the
      idea of a White House meeting, although they acknowledged it only after the
      Kremlin revealed it on Monday.


      It is not a small detail easily overlooked: A White House meeting would be Putin''s
      first since he met with President George W. Bush in 2005 and in 2001 before
      that. On that occasion, Bush said, "This is a new day in the long history of
      Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope."


      Such hopes of a better relationship all but evaporated during the Obama administration
      after Russia''s granting of asylum to NSA fugitive Edward Snowden in 2013, Moscow''s
      annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the shoot-down of a KLM passenger plane over
      eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists four months later. Those developments
      precipitated a U.S.-led move for economic sanctions against close Putin associates.


      More recently, there was the intelligence assessment that Russia meddled in
      the 2016 election, and less than a month ago, the accusation that the Kremlin
      poisoned a former Russian spy and his daughter in England. So why now reward
      Putin with a summit, possibly at the White House?


      There is also the question of what such a meeting could hope to achieve. Former
      diplomats say it is a very bad idea, and apparently as off-the-cuff as the Trump''s
      impromptu acceptance of a summit with Kim Jong Un in May without consulting
      his advisers, U.S allies or China.


      In some ways, the suggestion of a White House summit with Putin seems even more
      ill-advised, given the president''s public silence about the Kremlin''s attempted
      assassination of the former Russian spy and his daughter, and in light of his
      ambivalent comments about Moscow''s election meddling.


      "You should only have a summit if it is achieving a concrete American national
      security objective," said former Obama ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul.
      "And you should never have a summit just to explain pleasantries, especially
      with someone who has President Putin''s recent record."


      McFaul added: "Traditionally, White House summits are reserved for big events
      when the United States and Russia are achieving positive outcomes. It is not
      clear that Trump and Putin are working together to achieve any outcomes, so
      what''s the purpose of the meeting?"


      For Putin, a White House meeting would give him the legitimacy he seeks, while
      undercutting the coalition of almost 30 nations that British Prime Minister
      Theresa May has brought together to punish Russia for its alleged use of a military-grade
      nerve agent.


      The initial reaction to Trump''s telephone diplomacy? Experts say it sends the
      wrong message not only to Putin, but also to the allies who had hoped they could
      count on America to be strong on Russia at a critical moment.'

      \ investigate and ultimately dismiss this employee for his outrageous behavior\
      \ with a former staffer, I believe it is important for the House Ethics Committee\
      \ to conduct its own inquiry into this matter,\" Esty said in a written statement,\
      \ acknowledging \"it certainly was far from a perfect process.\"\n\nEsty said\
      \ she wants the committee to \"clarify whether there was any wrongdoing\" on\
      \ her part.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement\
      \ issued before Esty announced she would not seek another term, \"As Congresswoman\
      \ Esty has acknowledged, her actions did not protect Ms. Kain and should have.\
      \ Congresswoman Esty has now appropriately requested an expedited review by\
      \ the Ethics Committee.\"\n\nEsty's announcement that she won't seek another\
      \ term comes amid calls for her resignation from a growing number of state politicians\
      \ in Connecticut, including fellow Democrats. Bob Duff, the Democratic state\
      \ Senate's majority leader, was among the latest to urge Esty to step down in\
      \ the midst of her third-term.\n\nDuff said Monday that he has spoken with Esty\
      \ about his concerns, acknowledging it was a difficult decision to call for\
      \ her resignation given her record in Congress.\n\n\"However, no matter the\
      \ hard work Elizabeth has exhibited and my admiration for her bipartisan accomplishments,\
      \ the news of the last few days is certainly disheartening,\" Duff said.\n\n\
      He said several points led him to call for Esty's resignation, including her\
      \ reluctance to speak out publicly about the situation and using taxpayer money\
      \ to pay her former chief of staff, Tony Baker, about $5,000 in severance. Staffers\
      \ said Esty repaid the federal government last week with her personal funds.\n\
      \nA spokesman for Baker told Hearst Connecticut Media and the Washington Post\
      \ that he denies some of the allegations. A phone number listed for a Tony Baker\
      \ in Columbus, Ohio, where the spokesman said the former chief of staff was\
      \ living, was disconnected.\n\nIn her letter to committee members, Esty said\
      \ she learned through a third party in 2016 about possible misconduct by Baker\
      \ involving a former staffer, who worked in her office from January 2013 to\
      \ March 2015. Esty has said she fired Baker three months later after receiving\
      \ an internal investigation report that revealed improper behavior by Baker\
      \ that affected multiple female staffers.\n\nBefore news of the controversy\
      \ broke, Esty had issued press releases calling for tougher harassment protections\
      \ for congressional staffers and was among those demanding that then-U.S. Rep.\
      \ John Conyers, of Michigan, resign amid allegations of misconduct."

      President Donald Trump on Monday morning unleashed another round of Twitter
      tough talk on illegal immigration, slamming Mexico and Democrats and demanding
      that Congress pass "border legislation."


      "Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ''Caravans'' of people
      enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they
      can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our
      country, which has no effective border laws," Trump wrote in the first of three
      early-morning tweets.


      The president added that "Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation"
      and "use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and
      People." The nuclear option refers to a last-resort maneuver in the Senate to
      change the rules so that action can be taken with a simple majority of 51 votes
      and not the 60-vote threshold that is needed for the minority to break a filibuster.


      "Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don''t allow
      them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!" he wrote.


      Trump also resumed fire on the issue of DACA, writing that it is "dead because
      the Democrats didn''t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA
      bandwagon."'

      \ to answer any of the questions in connection with any census or survey shall\
      \ be fined a maximum of $100, or a maximum of $500 if the person gives false\
      \ information.\n\nIn theory, noncitizens should not fear answering census questions.\
      \ Surveys are mailed to addresses, rather than to specific individuals. Not\
      \ including individual names on the address label is meant to protect the confidentiality\
      \ of the participating households.\n\nAdditionally, federal law provides immunity\
      \ for persons who give answers to census questions. Information furnished cannot\
      \ be \"used to the detriment of the persons to whom such information relates.\"\
      \ Census reports may not be admitted as evidence or used in any action or proceeding,\
      \ without consent.\n\nThese laws are designed to deter someone from refusing\
      \ to answer questions on the census claiming a Fifth Amendment privilege against\
      \ self-incrimination.\n\nPractically speaking, though, anyone who is concerned\
      \ about their legal status may not want to volunteer this to the same federal\
      \ government that could deport them. It's hardly a sentiment limited only to\
      \ noncitizens. In past enumerations, some Republican leaders have all but encouraged\
      \ open defiance of the law.\n\nThen-Sen. Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican,\
      \ once advised constituents to fill out \"the basic census information\" but\
      \ added that if they felt \"their privacy is being invaded by those (additional)\
      \ questions, they (could) choose not to answer those questions.\"\n\nAnd George\
      \ W. Bush, then a candidate for president, said he \"(understood) why people\
      \ don't want to give over that information to the government.\"\n\nProsecutions\
      \ for failure to participate in the census are rare; most significant court\
      \ cases dealing with these crimes date back to the 1970s.\n\nThe perceived risk\
      \ of answering remains greater than the virtually nonexistent risk of not answering\
      \ because the Justice Department is not likely to start prosecuting offenders\
      \ for refusing to answer.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated that\
      \ illegal immigration will be a priority for the DOJ under his command, but\
      \ going after noncitizens who refuse to answer census questions, motivated by\
      \ fear of being removed from the country, would contradict the overall message\
      \ the census is trying to send: It is here to count you, not to hurt you. Plus,\
      \ courts have indicated in the past that purposeful discrimination by census\
      \ authorities can give rise to a defense of selective prosecution.\n\nUltimately,\
      \ the refusal to answer census questions is a federal crime, but not really.\n\
      \nSome categories of federal criminal statutes are heavily enforced. Drug crimes\
      \ and immigration crimes make up over 50 percent of the federal prosecution\
      \ caseload.\n\nThen there are those federal crimes that are technically crimes,\
      \ but not really. For example, it's a federal crime for a peanut dealer to refuse\
      \ to tell the government how many peanuts he has. It's also a federal crime\
      \ to mail a package of dead bees without writing \"DEAD BEES\" on every side\
      \ of the box, using black letters at least an inch tall.\n\nThere are a lot\
      \ of federal crimes. Not all of them are enforced. Refusing to answer the census\
      \ or lying on it will likely remain in that second category \u2014 a crime,\
      \ but not really.\n\nDanny Cevallos is an MSNBC legal analyst. Follow @CevallosLaw\

    text: "The House passed a bill to reform the byzantine process for reporting sexual\
      \ harassment on the Hill on February 6. The Senate still hasn\u2019t taken up\
      \ the measure, and women in the Senate have had enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, 22\
      \ women senators, both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 every single sitting\
      \ female member of the Senate \u2014 wrote a letter to Senate leadership demanding\
      \ the legislation go up for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201CInaction is\
      \ unacceptable when a survey shows that four out of 10 women congressional staffers\
      \ believe that sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill,\u201D the letter\
      \ reads, \u201Cand one out of six women in the same survey responded that they\
      \ have been the survivors of sexual harassment.\u201D\n\nThe letter, sent Wednesday\
      \ to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,\
      \ blasts Senate leadership for stonewalling on reforms to the Congressional\
      \ Accountability Act of 1995, the legislation that sets forth sexual harassment\
      \ guidance and policies for congressional offices and members.\n\nIn a statement,\
      \ Schumer\u2019s office told Vox, \u201CWe strongly agree that the Senate should\
      \ quickly take up legislation to combat sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.\u201D\
      \ McConnell\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording\
      \ to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, provisions of the legislation \u2014 which has\
      \ bipartisan support \u2014 were even initially included in the omnibus bill\
      \ President Trump signed on Friday but were stripped out at the last minute.\
      \ Those provisions included major changes to the sexual harassment complaint\
      \ process and a requirement that taxpayer funds used to settle harassment lawsuits\
      \ be reimbursed.\n\nRead the full text of the letter below.\n\nDear Leader McConnell\
      \ and Senator Schumer:\n\nWe write to express our deep disappointment that the\
      \ Senate has failed to enact meaningful reforms to the Congressional Accountability\
      \ Act of 1995. We urge you to bring before the full Senate legislation that\
      \ would update and strengthen the procedures available to survivors of sexual\
      \ harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces.\n\nEveryone deserves\
      \ to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. In November,\
      \ with your leadership, the Senate took an important first step in the effort\
      \ to end harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces with the\
      \ passage of S. Res. 330, which requires anti-harassment and discrimination\
      \ training for all Senators and staff at least once each Congress. While this\
      \ training requirement was a significant step to address workplace harassment,\
      \ there was broad, bipartisan agreement at that time that more had to be done\
      \ to support survivors.\n\nAlthough the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA)\
      \ implemented meaningful reforms when it became law in 1995, it continues to\
      \ require survivors to endure an antiquated dispute resolution process, including\
      \ a month-long counseling session, forced mediation and a 30-day \u201Ccooling\
      \ off\u201D period before a victim can make a decision whether to pursue justice\
      \ in a courtroom or continue with administrative procedures. The time has come\
      \ to rewrite the CAA to provide a more equitable process that supports survivors\
      \ of harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s inaction stands in\
      \ stark contrast to the bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives that\
      \ led to the passage of bipartisan CAA reform legislation in February. The House\
      \ bill includes a number of important provisions, such as eliminating waiting\
      \ periods before a victim can take their case to court, increased transparency\
      \ for awards and settlements, and a requirement that Members of the Senate and\
      \ House pay for an award or settlement stemming from a case of sexual harassment\
      \ or discrimination that they personally commit.\n\nWhen the Senate considers\
      \ CAA reform legislation, we will also have the ability to address an inequity\
      \ that now exists between House and Senate staff. The House of Representatives\
      \ passed H. Res. 724 that provides House staff who are survivors of harassment\
      \ or discrimination access to free legal representation. Senate staff who face\
      \ similar harassment or discrimination must pay personally for legal representation\
      \ or represent themselves through complicated legal proceedings. Therefore,\
      \ the Senate must act quickly to provide Senate staff with the same resources\
      \ as their House colleagues.\n\nInaction is unacceptable when a survey shows\
      \ that four out of 10 women congressional staffers believe that sexual harassment\
      \ is a problem on Capitol Hill and one out of six women in the same survey responded\
      \ that they have been the survivors of sexual harassment. Survivors who have\
      \ bravely come forward to share their stories have brought to light just how\
      \ widespread harassment and discrimination continue to be throughout Capitol\
      \ Hill. No longer can we allow the perpetrators of these crimes to hide behind\
      \ a 23-year-old law. It\u2019s time to rewrite the Congressional Accountability\
      \ Act and update the process through which survivors seek justice."

    text: "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the weekend, the March for Our Lives event featured\
      \ gigantic rallies across the nation, including one in Washington, D.C., that\
      \ drew several hundred thousand people \u2014 depending on estimates, perhaps\
      \ the largest single rally there in American history. It was an inspiring demonstration\
      \ of American citizens exercising their democratic liberties.\n\nBut it also\
      \ badly triggered the hyper-sensitive snowflakes in conservative politics and\
      \ media, who apparently need a safe space from political assemblies to petition\
      \ the government for redress of grievances. They have been in continuous meltdown\
      \ ever since.\n\nHypocrisy aside, it's a good indication of the political threat\
      \ they perceive from the post-Parkland gun control movement. The long-term prospects\
      \ for the extremist views of movement conservatives on gun regulation do not\
      \ look good.\n\nLet's roll the tape. At National Review, Rich Lowry wrote a\
      \ post entitled \"The Teenage Demagogues\" operatically bemoaning how the \"\
      braying spirit of the student gun-control advocacy\" is \"making our public\
      \ debate even more poisonous and less civil.\" Why? Because the teenagers (hyperbolically)\
      \ suggest that the NRA is basically fine with clockwork massacres of schoolchildren,\
      \ if the alternative is modest regulation of gun manufacturers or restrictions\
      \ on gun purchases.\n\n(How one might draw that conclusion from the awesomely\
      \ deranged pop-veined ranting of NRA President Wayne LaPierre or spokeswoman\
      \ Dana Loesch is left as an exercise for the reader.)\n\nElsewhere at National\
      \ Review, Joe Bissonnette excused his attention to the \"ingratitude, sanctimony,\
      \ and profanity\" of Parkland survivor David Hogg (who Erick Erickson previously\
      \ called a \"high school bully\") by baldly asserting that \"manipulative adults\
      \ in the media are deploying him as a useful idiot.\"\n\nAt Red State, Sarah\
      \ Rumpf briefly dipped into an Alex Jones-style conspiracy theory, twisting\
      \ a bit of vague language into an absolutely crackpot argument that Hogg was\
      \ not actually present at the massacre, before having to shamefacedly retract\
      \ the entire article.\n\nWhat explains these defamatory attacks on a bunch of\
      \ children simply trying to stop their fellow students from being senselessly\
      \ butchered? Many left-leaning writers have correctly noted that the Parkland\
      \ students' sustained political attention has a lot to do with the wealth of\
      \ the community. A great many massacres in poorer communities have gone without\
      \ the weeks-long national outrage and mobilization that followed the Parkland\
      \ shooting.\n\nOn one hand, it is of course unfair for political influence to\
      \ be correlated with wealth (though I would argue that Parkland was also a tipping\
      \ point phenomenon). But on the other, it shows the thinness of the political\
      \ ledge onto which the maximalist gun rights brigade \u2014 which includes just\
      \ about the entire Republican Party \u2014 has marched itself. Gun violence\
      \ is not something restricted to poor rural trailer parks or urban ghettos.\
      \ It's a regular occurrence in the most privileged communities in the land.\n\
      \nBut as the GOP has become composed of characterological extremists, they have\
      \ become all but incapable of negotiation or compromise. The Republican establishment\
      \ is fervently convinced that any slight deviation from current party dogma\
      \ is nothing less than the death knell of American freedom.\n\nSo when an incomprehensibly\
      \ gruesome massacre strikes in a wealthy neighborhood, where the citizenry is\
      \ meaningfully politically enfranchised, and it sparks a massive nationwide\
      \ demonstration, Republicans are largely caught flat-footed. To be fair, President\
      \ Trump did recently take a tiny but meaningful step, invoking executive authority\
      \ to ban bump stocks like the one used in the Las Vegas massacre (though not\
      \ in Parkland). But that is mostly just plugging a loophole in the already-existing\
      \ automatic weapons ban, and will come under instant legal assault from conservatives.\
      \ The legal question could be solved by legislation, but such a ban would go\
      \ nowhere under this Republican Congress.\n\nIn the rest of the party, the best\
      \ they can offer is stuff like what former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum proffered\
      \ over the weekend: learn CPR instead of \"looking to someone else to solve\
      \ their problems.\"\n\nFor one thing, it's deeply telling that in reality, a\
      \ hypothetical elementary school combat medic trying to save their homeroom\
      \ classmates from grapefruit-sized high-velocity rifle wounds would be most\
      \ concerned with staunching bleeding, not CPR. Conservatives can't even get\
      \ their transparently bad faith deflection arguments right.\n\nAnd that is why\
      \ they are largely reduced to smearing and defaming a bunch of kids trying to\
      \ participate in American democracy. It's the only political move they have\
      \ left.\n\nBut more importantly, by refusing to accept even slight compromise\
      \ in the gun debate, conservatives have made their position extremely brittle.\
      \ After Parkland, public opinion has shifted fast in favor of commonsense regulations\
      \ like universal background checks, a national gun registry, and reversing the\
      \ ban on government-funded gun violence research. Meanwhile, fanatical anti-Democrat\
      \ partisanship from the NRA is purging out the last vestiges of pro-gun sentiment\
      \ from that party. If and when Republicans lose their grip on national power,\
      \ new gun control measures are liable to go much further than they would have\
      \ if the NRA and Republicans had accepted a tactical retreat.\n\nIt will serve\
      \ them right."

      \ aides under investigation by the special counsel, according to two people\
      \ briefed on the interviews.\n\nIn one meeting with lawyers from the White House\

      \ power, according to a person briefed on the conversation. The lawyers explained\
      \ that the president\u2019s powers were broad, the person said. And in other\
      \ meetings with senior advisers, the president raised the prospect of pardoning\
      \ Mr. Flynn, according to two people present.\n\nLegal experts are divided about\
      \ whether a pardon offer, even if given in exchange for continued loyalty, can\
      \ be considered obstruction of justice. Presidents have constitutional authority\
      \ to pardon people who face or were convicted of federal charges.\n\nBut even\
      \ if a pardon were ultimately aimed at hindering an investigation, it might\

      \ say this: When you look at what\u2019s gone on with the F.B.I. and with the\
      \ Justice Department, people are very, very angry.\u201D\n\nMr. Trump has been\
      \ preoccupied with the investigation into Mr. Flynn since at least early last\
      \ year. In February 2017, alone in the Oval Office with the F.B.I. director\
      \ at the time, James B. Comey, the president asked him to end the investigation,\
      \ Mr. Comey told lawmakers. After that episode became public, Mr. Mueller was\
      \ appointed by the Justice Department to be the special counsel.\n\nOn the day\
      \ after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty, the president wrote in a Twitter post said\
      \ to be composed by Mr. Dowd that he fired Mr. Flynn for, among other things,\
      \ lying to the F.B.I. But Mr. Trump continued to publicly defend his former\

      It is not clear what Mr. Flynn has told the special counsel as part of his cooperation\

      \ have focused on what Mr. Flynn told the president about his calls during the\
      \ transition with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey\

      \ who reaffirmed their commitment to letting Mueller finish his investigation\
      \ into Russia interference in the 2016 election and whether the Russians coordinated\
      \ with the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201CWe urge President Trump to allow the Special\
      \ Counsel to complete his work without impediment,\u201D Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.)\
      \ and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), authors of a bill to protect Mueller, said\
      \ in a joint statement seemingly out of the blue, \u201Cwhich is in the best\
      \ interest of the American people, the President, and our nation.\u201D\n\n\
      Tillis and Coons introduced a bill nearly a year ago that would allow Mueller\
      \ to challenge his firing in court if he ever needed to. That and another bipartisan\
      \ bill to protect Mueller have never gotten past a September hearing, even as\
      \ Trump's attacks on Mueller have escalated.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman\
      \ Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the gatekeeper for such bills, has said he's\
      \ worried that it could be unconstitutional to limit which members of the executive\
      \ branch the president could fire or hire.\n\n(Side note: Trump technically\
      \ can't fire Mueller, who answers to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.\

      \ particularly eager to take up the legislation after Trump directly attacked\
      \ Mueller for the first time earlier this month.\n\nThe Mueller probe should\
      \ never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.\

      \ is out of town on a two-week break. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and\
      \ eight other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to five\
      \ Justice Department officials asking for their commitment to protect Mueller.\n\
      \nI'm excerpting a sizable chunk of the letter, with the highlights in bold:\n\
      \n[W]e have significant concerns that the president or his White House could\
      \ order individuals at the Department of Justice with the authority to oversee\
      \ Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s probe to interfere with the probe or shut it\
      \ down. You fall in the line of succession at the Department of Justice if Deputy\
      \ Attorney General Rosenstein were to either resign or be removed. We write\
      \ to request that you provide a written and public commitment that you will\
      \ not interfere in the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling\
      \ in the 2016 elections, possible collusion with such meddling by the Trump\
      \ campaign, efforts to obstruct justice, and any related inquiry.\n\nIn an interview\
      \ Tuesday night with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Blumenthal cited \u201Cswirling,\u201D\
      \ \u201Cunconfirmed\u201D reports that raised his alarm that the president may\
      \ be attempting to fire Mueller. \u201CWith Congress now out of town and therefore\

      \ Post reported in January that Trump tried to fire Mueller in June. The Times\
      \ also recently reported Trump then may have moved to publicly deny he ever\
      \ thought about firing Mueller. And after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired\
      \ top FBI official Andrew McCabe hours before McCabe was set to retire earlier\
      \ this month, Trump started attacking Mueller directly by name.\n\nIt's not\
      \ lost on lawmakers and observers that Trump is debating whether to sit down\
      \ with Mueller for a potentially perilous interview, with a quickly thinning\
      \ legal team in disarray. Meanwhile, Mueller's investigation inches closer to\
      \ the president, with news Wednesday that a former Trump aide who is likely\
      \ cooperating with Mueller had regular contact with someone who had ties to\
      \ Russian intelligence and news that Trump's former lawyer broached the subject\
      \ of pardoning two of Trump's former campaign aides.\n\nThe last time Congress\
      \ left Washington for an extended period, none of that had even happened or\
      \ been reported. And Democrats publicly warned Trump not to fire Mueller then,\
      \ too. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence\
      \ Committee, went on the Senate floor before Congress's December break and warned\
      \ Trump that firing Mueller would be a \u201Cgross abuse of power.\u201D\n\n\
      So clearly there's a pattern here of Congress leaving town, and some lawmakers\
      \ getting skittish that their absence will embolden Trump to do something we\
      \ know he's already considered at least once.\n\nThe Times has reported that\
      \ Trump's aides were never quite sure the president fully backed away from firing\
      \ Mueller.\n\nIt sounds as if some members of Congress aren't, either.\n\nAaron\

    text: 'President Donald Trump on Wednesday named White House physician Ronny Jackson
      as his pick to replace Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.


      The president said in a statement that Jackson, a Navy rear admiral, "has seen
      firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation
      for the debt our great country owes them."


      Jackson, a longtime presidential physician, oversaw Trump''s annual medical
      checkup, which he said "went exceptionally well." He also presided over Barack
      Obama''s last physical in office in 2016.


      Trump thanked Shulkin for his service and said Robert Wilkie will serve as acting
      secretary. Wilkie currently serves as undersecretary of defense for personnel
      and readiness at the Department of Defense.


      Shulkin has been under fire after an internal watchdog report revealed that
      the VA had improperly approved taxpayers footing the bill for a trip Shulkin''s
      wife took with him to Europe last year.


      That same report found that Shulkin told a subordinate to handle personal plans
      for him and his wife during that trip, and that he improperly accepted tickets
      to the Wimbledon tennis tournament.


      Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, said in
      a statement that Shulkin "ultimately became a distraction from the important
      task of improving health care for our veterans."


      "We are hopeful that this change will end the recent distractions at the VA
      and put the focus back on advancing policy that will ensure veterans get the
      health care and other benefits they have earned," Caldwell said.


      Shulkin''s departure comes on the heels of a series of exit announcements from
      the Trump administration in this month alone, including those by Secretary of
      State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor Director H.R. McMaster, National
      Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Communications Director Hope Hicks, and
      Trump''s personal aide John McEntee.


      McMaster''s resignation was announced March 22, just hours after John Dowd,
      Trump''s lead lawyer for an ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016
      presidential election, quit.


      Shulkin was the only member of Trump''s cabinet who was a holdover from the
      Obama administration. He has been engaged recently in a nasty intra-departmental
      fight with political appointees in the VA, a fight that has included him ceasing
      to use the VA''s own spokesman as his contact for the media.


      In addition to his own IG''s report on his wife flying to Europe at taxpayer
      expense, Shulkin earlier this month was hit by another IG report that criticized
      the department for a series of failures at a big veterans'' hospital in Washington.

    text: "A federal judge ruled that the District of Columbia and Maryland may proceed\
      \ with a lawsuit against President Trump alleging that Trump\u2019s business\
      \ dealings have violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on receiving improper \u201C\
      emoluments,\u201D or payments, from individual states and foreign governments.\n\
      \nThe ruling, by U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte in Maryland, marks the\
      \ first time that a lawsuit of this kind has cleared the initial legal hurdle\
      \ \u2014 a finding that the plaintiffs have legal standing to sue the president.\n\
      \nIn his opinion, Messitte gave credence to arguments by D.C. Attorney General\
      \ Karl A. Racine (D) and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) that Trump\
      \ unfairly profits from business at downtown Washington\u2019s Trump International\
      \ Hotel, in which the president continues to hold a financial interest.\n\n\
      Messitte cited examples of government clients \u2014 including Kuwait and Bahrain\
      \ \u2014\n\npatronizing the Washington hotel, possibly to the detriment of competitors\
      \ and taxpayers. He wrote that Maryland and the District had sufficiently argued\
      \ that Trump\u2019s hotel \u201Chas had and almost certainly will continue to\
      \ have an unlawful effect on competition.\u201D\n\nAs part of that ruling, Messitte\
      \ said he rejected an argument made by critics of the lawsuit \u2014 that, under\
      \ the Constitution, only Congress may decide whether the president has violated\
      \ the emoluments clauses.\n\nD.C. and Maryland are suing President Trump for\
      \ violating a little-known constitutional provision called \"the emoluments\
      \ clause.\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201CIn absence of Congressional\
      \ approval, this Court holds that it may review the actions of the President\
      \ to determine if they comply with the law,\u201D Messitte wrote.\n\nIf the\
      \ ruling stands, it could allow Racine and Frosh to seek internal documents\
      \ from the Trump Organization to determine how much money the Washington hotel\
      \ has taken in from state and foreign governments.\n\nMessitte\u2019s ruling\
      \ largely narrowed the lawsuit\u2019s scope to the Washington hotel, saying\
      \ that the District and Maryland had standing to sue because they could plausibly\
      \ claim to have been injured by Trump\u2019s receipt of payments from foreign\
      \ and state governments.\n\nFor one thing, he said, the two jurisdictions have\
      \ financial interests in their own convention centers \u2014 one in downtown\
      \ Washington, another in Bethesda, Md. They argued that the Trump hotel had\
      \ an unfair advantage in the battle for meeting business.\n\nIn addition, the\
      \ court said, the District and Maryland could speak on behalf of their own businesses,\
      \ which might also see clients lured away by the chance to do business with\
      \ the president.\n\n\u201CThe Court concludes that [the District and Maryland]\
      \ are, quite plausibly, trying to protect a large segment of their commercial\
      \ residents and hospitality industry employees from economic harm,\u201D he\
      \ wrote.\n\nMessitte also raised examples of state governments having to make\
      \ decisions related to the president\u2019s company, which Frosh and Racine\
      \ termed an \u201Cintolerable dilemma\u201D between losing revenue or risking\
      \ repercussions from the president. The judge cited a decision by District tax\
      \ officials to lower the Trump hotel\u2019s tax bill by nearly $1 million and\
      \ a $6 million tax break being granted to a Trump-affiliated development by\
      \ Mississippi officials.\n\nThe Trump International Hotel inside the federally\
      \ owned Old Post Office building in downtown D.C. has been mired in controversy\
      \ even before opening its doors. (Claritza Jimenez,Osman Malik,Jonathan O'Connell/The\
      \ Washington Post)\n\nThe Justice Department, which is representing the president\
      \ in this case, did not immediately say whether it would appeal. \u201CAs we\
      \ argued, we believe this case should be dismissed, and we will continue to\
      \ defend the president in court,\u201D spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nAfter\
      \ consulting with attorneys, Trump vowed last year to donate some profits from\
      \ foreign governments to the U.S. treasury. This month the Trump Organization\
      \ said it donated $151,470 but declined to explain how it came up with the amount.\n\
      \nAlthough Trump said he gave up day-to-day management of his business while\
      \ he is in the White House, he still owns his businesses and can withdraw money\
      \ from them at any time.\n\nA statement from the Trump Organization said: \u201C\
      While the Trump Organization is not a party to the lawsuit, the Court\u2019\
      s decision today does significantly narrow the scope of the case. The Court\
      \ has yet to rule on several additional arguments, which we believe should result\
      \ in a complete dismissal.\u201D\n\nIn an interview, Frosh said that \u201C\
      overall we are extremely pleased\u201D and that he and Racine would be seeking\
      \ the president\u2019s financial documents and tax returns as the case proceeded.\n\
      \n\u201CThe basic principle here is Donald Trump is not above the law, and the\
      \ court recognized that and said that we can enforce the nation\u2019s original\
      \ anti-corruption law \u2014 the emoluments clause,\u201D he said.\n\nThis case\
      \ was filed last year, one of a raft of lawsuits in the months after Trump\u2019\
      s inauguration, all of them alleging that he was violating the Constitution\u2019\
      s emoluments clauses.\n\nThose clauses were dusty corners of the Constitution,\
      \ rarely tested in court during 240-plus years of American history.\n\nOne bars\
      \ federal officers from taking presents, or emoluments, from foreign governments.\
      \ The other prohibits presidents from taking side payments from individual states.\n\
      \nIn these lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that Trump violated one or both of\
      \ these bans, because foreign and state governments have rented hotel rooms\
      \ or banquet halls at his businesses.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have said that\
      \ the term \u201Cemolument\u201D was never meant to cover transactions such\
      \ as this \u2014 not outright gifts to the president but purchases made at fair-market\
      \ value.\n\nThe first step in all these cases has been an argument over what\
      \ lawyers call \u201Cstanding\u201D \u2014 in essence, determining whether the\
      \ plaintiff has a right to sue.\n\nIn December, for instance, a federal judge\
      \ threw out one of the emoluments lawsuits, brought by the nonprofit watchdog\
      \ group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nU.S. District\
      \ Judge George B. Daniels ruled that the watchdog group lacked standing. He\
      \ stated that the Constitution gave Congress \u2014 and only Congress \u2014\
      \ the right to enforce these rules.\n\n\u201CAs the only political branch with\
      \ the power to consent to violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, Congress\
      \ is the appropriate body to determine whether, and to what extent, Defendant\u2019\
      s conduct unlawfully infringes on that power,\u201D Daniels wrote in his ruling.\n\
      \nThe case involving the District and Maryland had a hearing earlier this year\
      \ before Messitte at a federal court in Greenbelt, Md.\n\nIn that hearing, the\
      \ Justice Department, arguing on Trump\u2019s behalf, made a similar argument\
      \ in an effort to throw out the attorney generals\u2019 suit. Brett Shumate,\
      \ a Justice Department lawyer, said that states such as Maryland had no right\
      \ to sue Trump over these clauses.\n\n\u201CThe states are not roving constitutional\
      \ watchdogs,\u201D Shumate said. He continued: \u201CThis is ultimately a political\
      \ dispute. It should be left to the political process.\u201D\n\nIn his ruling\
      \ Wednesday, Messitte rejected that idea.\n\n\u201CThe thrust of the President\u2019\
      s argument that only Congress can act is particularly concerning,\u201D he wrote\
      \ in a footnote. \u201CSuppose a majority (simple? two-thirds?) of Congress\
      \ (the House? the Senate? both?) is controlled by one party \u2014 that of the\
      \ President. And suppose the Congress never undertakes to approve or disapprove\
      \ the President\u2019s receipt of such \u2018emoluments.\u2019 \u201D\n\n\u201C\
      The President could continue to receive unlimited \u2018emoluments\u2019 from\
      \ foreign and state governments without the least oversight and with absolute\
      \ impunity,\u201D Messitte wrote."

      \ It's also a move that will have very tangible affects on Facebook's business,\
      \ as many marketers rely on this type of data to target ads on the platform.\n\
      \nHow it works: Facebook previously let marketers target advertisers using three\

      Devin Nunes took in more than $1 million in the first quarter of 2018, a sign
      of Democrats'' enthusiasm to oust the California congressman who has allied
      himself closely with President Donald Trump.


      Andrew Janz, the Deputy District Attorney in Fresno County, is still considered
      a long shot in his bid to unseat Nunes. CNN currently rates the 22nd District
      as a "safe Republican" seat. But Nunes'' role in running interference for Trump
      on the investigations into Russia''s role in the 2016 election has made him
      a target for Democrats nationwide.


      According to fundraising figures provided to CNN by the campaign, Janz has raised
      more than $1 million so far in 2018 with just three days left in the first quarter.
      The campaign received a huge influx in fundraising cash from donors across the
      country in the wake of Nunes role in releasing a controversial memo detailing
      concerns Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee had with the federal
      investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.


      "We feel like he is the one person that is really standing in the way of the
      (FBI Special Counsel) Robert Mueller investigation," Janz told CNN. "We think
      people deserve to know what happened to our elections in 2016 and what is happening
      in 2018. And every day my opponent is out there trying to undermine federal
      law enforcement, the special prosecutors probe and really working for Trump
      instead of the American people."


      Janz said that Nunes'' focus on defending the Trump administration''s role in
      the investigation, instead of focusing on issues important to California voters,
      is part of what is leading to the fundraising surge.

    text: "When President Donald Trump\u2018s lawyer Michael Cohen drew up a nondisclosure\
      \ agreement to keep Stormy Daniels from speaking about an alleged affair in\
      \ exchange for $130,000, he included an arbitration clause to keep any disputes\
      \ about the contract out of the courts. Nevertheless, Daniels is pushing forward\
      \ with a lawsuit, and even wants Trump to testify under oath at a deposition.\
      \ If a judge lets it happen, it could be Cohen\u2019s fault.\n\nPart of the\
      \ amended complaint that Daniels\u2019 attorney Michael Avenatti filed on Tuesday\
      \ calls the arbitration clause into question for two reasons. First, it says\
      \ that Cohen wouldn\u2019t be protected by it because the clause only made reference\
      \ to possible disputes between Daniels and Trump. This also tends to support\
      \ Avenatti\u2019s argument that because Trump never signed the agreement, the\
      \ contract is unenforceable.\n\nAvenatti also argues that the arbitration clause\
      \ is unenforceable because, when taken alongside other parts of the contract,\
      \ it makes the agreement too one-sided by giving Trump more rights than Daniels.\n\
      \nContracts, including Stormy Daniels\u2019 NDA, generally contain a severability\
      \ clause, so that even if part of it is considered unenforceable, other parts\
      \ remain in effect. So if there was a problem with some other part of the nondisclosure\
      \ agreement, the arbitration clause would still be alive and kicking. In this\
      \ case, however, not only is Daniels claiming that the entire agreement is bad,\
      \ but that the arbitration clause in particular is no good.\n\nBecause the arbitration\
      \ clause is being called into question, Avenatti and Daniels have a legal issue\
      \ that a judge will likely want to clear up. If the court decides the clause\
      \ is fine, then it would go to arbitration, but the judge would want to take\
      \ a look at the matter before making that decision. Part of that process could\
      \ include allowing depositions of Trump and Cohen.\n\nCriminal defense attorney\
      \ and CNN legal analyst Page Pate addressed this very issue on Wednesday, saying\
      \ that even though arbitration clauses are usually enforced, this one was so\
      \ shoddily drafted that Trump could end up having to testify as a result.\n\n\
      \u201CNinety-nine percent of the time, that\u2019s all the judge has to do.\
      \ If you have an arbitration clause in the agreement, the judge is done with\
      \ it, he sends it to an arbitrator, and you don\u2019t see the inside of a courtroom\
      \ and you don\u2019t have this type of a deposition,\u201D Pate told host Brianna\
      \ Keilar.\n\n\u201CBut I think this arbitration clause and this entire nondisclosure\
      \ agreement was so poorly drafted that now Stormy Daniels\u2019 legal team does\
      \ have a solid legal argument that there was never any deal in place,\u201D\
      \ he continued, \u201Cand that is an issue that a federal judge has to pass\
      \ on before the case is sent to arbitration.\u201D\n\nBasically, if Cohen had\
      \ done a better job drafting the contract, a Trump deposition would be highly\
      \ unlikely because the whole matter would be sent to an arbitrator. If Trump\
      \ now does end up having to testify under oath, he could have his own attorney\
      \ to blame.\n\nRonn Blitzer is Senior Editor of Law&Crime and a former New York\

      \ just over a year ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has made no secret that\
      \ his personal mission is to do the opposite.\n\nTime after time, Pruitt has\
      \ ignored his agency\u2019s own data, analysis and recommendations in order\
      \ to protect corporate polluters. He has given new meaning to the lobbyist revolving\
      \ door, hiring people who have close connections to the industries that the\
      \ EPA is supposed to regulate. And he wasted taxpayer money for his own personal\
      \ comfort.\n\nBy now, it is clear that Pruitt is unfit for public office and\
      \ needs to go.\n\nTake, first, the \u201Cbrief\u201D meeting between Pruitt\
      \ and a top Dow Chemical executive last March. Less than a month later, Pruitt\
      \ announced he would refuse to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, produced by Dow,\
      \ from being sprayed on food, despite a review from EPA scientists that found\
      \ even trace amounts of chlorpyrifos can interfere with children\u2019s brain\
      \ development. In refusing to go along with EPA experts\u2019 advice to ban\
      \ chlorpyrifos, Pruitt rejected science, endangered children\u2019s health and\
      \ benefited his industry friends all at once.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In\
      \ January 2016, two employees of the agribusiness Syngenta assigned about 20\
      \ workers to work in a field recently treated with chlorpyrifos in Hawaii, exposing\
      \ them to dangerous levels of the pesticide. Later that year, the EPA under\
      \ the leadership of Gina McCarthy announced it would fine Syngenta about $4.9\
      \ million for its improper use of the chemical during the January incident.\n\
      \nBut help for Syngenta was on the way when Pruitt became administrator. In\
      \ October 2017, Pruitt hired Jeff Sands, a former Syngenta lobbyist, as his\
      \ senior adviser for agriculture issues. In December, the White House counsel\
      \ granted Sands an ethics waiver to ensure that he could continue to work on\
      \ issues related to his former employer \u2014 including the issues that he\
      \ had lobbied previously, such as the EPA\u2019s regulation of pesticides.\n\
      \nThen in February, the EPA reduced Syngenta\u2019s fine for violating pesticide\
      \ regulations to $150,000 without explanation, requiring the company to spend\
      \ an additional $400,000 on worker training. In all, the company saved about\
      \ $4.4 million.\n\nAnd then in March, Sands \u2014 perhaps feeling his mission\
      \ accomplished \u2014 left the EPA.\n\nNo one knows why Pruitt decided to reduce\
      \ Syngenta\u2019s fine. No one knows whether Sands\u2019s advice influenced\
      \ that decision. But the timing raises serious questions, and Pruitt should\
      \ immediately and proactively release all of the documents detailing his decision-making\
      \ process.\n\nIn addition to throwing the EPA\u2019s doors wide open for corporate\
      \ polluters, Pruitt has wasted taxpayer dollars. The extent of Pruitt\u2019\
      s excess is still coming to light, but we do know that Pruitt spent $43,000\
      \ on a soundproof phone booth, which the Government Accountability Office is\
      \ investigating, and almost $9,000 to install biometric locks in his office\
      \ and to have it swept for listening devices. He also tried to spend $120,000\
      \ to hire a Republican political consulting firm to track press coverage of\
      \ the EPA, but that deal failed after it was revealed that one of the firm\u2019\
      s lawyers worked to monitor EPA employees critical of Pruitt or President Trump.\n\
      \nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said the EPA will\
      \ open up a national debate on climate change in 2018, part of a list of priorities\
      \ for the year in an interview with Reuters on Jan. 9. (Reuters)\n\nMeanwhile,\
      \ Pruitt has made a habit of using taxpayer money to avoid ordinary citizens\
      \ who want to criticize him. In response to questions from Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.),\
      \ chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Pruitt was\
      \ forced to release documents indicating that he spent more than $105,000 on\
      \ first-class flights in his first year at the EPA alone. The Post recently\
      \ reported that one week\u2019s worth of travel in June 2017 by Pruitt and his\
      \ staff cost about $120,000, which the EPA inspector general is investigating.\n\
      \nRemarkably, even the White House is fed up with this behavior. Pruitt was\
      \ recently scolded by the White House for the embarrassing stories around his\
      \ preference for first-class travel.\n\nEnough is enough. Pruitt has failed\
      \ to demonstrate that he can lead the EPA without putting American lives at\
      \ risk or wantonly wasting taxpayer money. It\u2019s time to give him the boot."

    text: "\n\nPresident Barack Obama speaks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton\
      \ on Nov. 1, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio. (Ty Wright/Getty Images)\n\nThe 2010 Affordable\
      \ Care Act ratcheted up taxes for the richest Americans while redirecting more\
      \ than $16 billion to the poorest income bracket in the country, according to\
      \ a report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSeveral new taxes in the\
      \ law \u2014 often referred to as Obamacare \u2014 increased the average tax\
      \ burden of the richest 1 percent of Americans by about $21,000 per year, decreasing\
      \ their average annual income by about 1.2 percent, the CBO said in the report.\
      \ The richest 20 percent of Americans paid, on average, an additional $1,100\
      \ annually because of these new taxes, the biggest of which include a tax on\
      \ investment income and another on health insurers.\n\nThe provisions to raise\
      \ money for the ACA did not go into effect until 2013, three years after the\
      \ law's passage. The CBO's report is based on data from 2014 and does not include\
      \ tax data since then. (The CBO report, which tracks American income inequality\
      \ broadly, says there was not available relevant data for the years since.)\n\
      \n[ Republicans knock holes in Affordable Care Act but don\u2019t demolish the\
      \ law ]\n\nThe report also shows the ACA boosted incomes for those at the bottom\
      \ of the income distribution, primarily through expanding Medicaid, the nation's\
      \ health insurance program for the poor, to millions more Americans.\n\nThe\
      \ law increased the average income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans by\
      \ $690 per person, and the average income of people in the second-poorest income\
      \ bracket by an average of $560 per person. (The CBO counted social insurance\
      \ benefits, including federal health care expenditures, as \u201Cincome\u201D\
      \ for this analysis.)\n\nOverall, Obamacare raised the average income of the\
      \ poorest income bracket by nearly 4 percent. The law lifted the income of the\
      \ second poorest bracket (with an average annual income of $42,000) by about\
      \ 1 percent.\n\nIn 2014, the federal government spent close to $38 billion on\
      \ Medicaid expansion, and more than half of that money went to the bottom 40\
      \ percent of income earners, according to CBO. Separate tax credits to low-income\
      \ Americans on Obamacare's individual markets cost the federal government $15\
      \ billion, while subsidies to help insurance companies offset the cost of expensive\
      \ patients cost an additional $3 billion, the report said. A majority of both\
      \ these funds also went to the poorer half of the country.\n\nThe CBO's findings\
      \ about Obamacare come at an uncertain moment for the law. Congressional Republicans\
      \ struck a key provision of the Affordable Care Act through their tax bill last\
      \ year, eliminating the individual mandate, which penalizes Americans who do\
      \ not buy health insurance. Subsequent congressional budget deals also delayed\
      \ several of the law's tax increases, primarily on industry. But only one of\
      \ those, the health insurance tax, was used for this CBO analysis, and it has\
      \ already gone back into effect, according to Larry Levitt, a health expert\
      \ at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRepublicans have chipped away at the law\
      \ in other ways that could diminish its generosity for poorer Americans. President\
      \ Trump has opened the door for states to impose work requirements and other\
      \ penalties on Medicaid populations, which experts say could push millions of\
      \ low-income Americans off the program. The administration has also cut funding\
      \ for outreach to potential enrollees in the law's insurance exchanges. Eliminating\
      \ the mandate alone will cut federal health spending by $338 billion over 10\
      \ years and reduce the number of uninsured people by 13 million, the CBO said\
      \ last fall.\n\nBut the law's tax increases on the rich largely remain intact.\
      \ Penalties for violating the individual mandate accounted for about $2 billion\
      \ annually of the $40 billion raised under Obamacare through new taxes. The\
      \ biggest tax passed under the Affordable Care Act, the one on investment income,\
      \ remains in place, and nearly 100 percent of it was paid by Americans in the\
      \ top income bracket.\n\n\u201CThe ACA has been wounded through Republican efforts,\
      \ but the big benefits to low-income people are still intact,\u201D Levitt said.\
      \ \u201CRedistribution is controversial, and that's what made passage of the\
      \ ACA so remarkable.\u201D"

    text: "To appreciate why birders consider an obscure wildlife refuge on the Texas\
      \ border to be the premier birding destination in America, you must walk its\
      \ trails in solitude, either at dusk or at dawn, as the birds emerge from the\
      \ forest looking for food.\n\nEarlier this month, I was alone on a path, deep\
      \ in thought, when a plain chachalaca appeared suddenly in the moss-covered\
      \ tree beside me. I froze as he dropped down into the scrub and the gray morning\
      \ light revealed his handsome cascade of brown plumage. After a few tentative\
      \ steps, I joined him in a slow procession, as he plucked insects from the soil\
      \ and I vicariously enjoyed the feast just 10 feet away.\n\nTiffany Kersten,\
      \ an environmental activist who settled here in South Texas after working as\
      \ a biologist in the refuge, lives for these surprise moments with the birds.\
      \ \u201CYou go out and you never know what you\u2019re going to see,\u201D she\
      \ told me as we watched ducks play in a lake inside the refuge. \u201CHere in\
      \ South Texas, every day you have the possibility that you\u2019ll go out birding\
      \ and you\u2019ll see a bird that has never been seen in the United States before\
      \ that belongs in Mexico and got lost.\u201D\n\nIn an unusual concession to\
      \ the environment, Congress just exempted the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge,\
      \ a 2,088-acre patch of extraordinary biodiversity on the Rio Grande river,\
      \ from the new sections of border wall it funded in the spending bill it passed\
      \ last week.\n\nBut it\u2019s a slim victory for conservation because Congress\
      \ also allocated $1.6 billion to build 33 miles of new barriers around the refuge\
      \ in the Rio Grande Valley. These wall sections \u2014 a compromise to assuage\
      \ President Trump, who wants a wall across the entire border \u2014 are expected\
      \ to disrupt several other protected parcels of land home to rare animals, plants,\
      \ and birds, including the National Butterfly Center, a state park, and several\
      \ other tracts of land in the federal wildlife refuge system.\n\nIn addition\
      \ to further fragmenting wildlife habitat on the border, the 33 miles of wall\
      \ could also create around 6,500 acres of \u201Cno man\u2019s land,\u201D cutting\
      \ off human access to nature and trapping wildlife the next time the Rio Grande\
      \ floods.\n\n\u201CPretty much all of the same species in the Santa Ana refuge\
      \ will be affected in these other tracts of land where the wall will go,\u201D\
      \ said Kersten.\n\nSo what do we know about where the wall will go and how bad\
      \ it will be for the environment? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe spending\
      \ bill saved a prized national wildlife refuge\n\nWhen you trace the 2,000-mile\
      \ border from west to east (as this Story Map project by Krista Schlyer did),\
      \ you find shrinking pockets of remarkable biological abundance. At the far\
      \ west is the Tijuana Estuary, a key salt marsh habitat for some 400 species\
      \ of migrating birds. At the far east, birds and butterflies stop through the\
      \ Rio Grande Valley, which is also a permanent home for mammals, reptiles, and\
      \ amphibians, including the endangered ocelot, that depend on the specific subtropical\
      \ ecosystem to survive.\n\nAs Norma Fowler, a biologist at the University of\
      \ Texas at Austin, and co-authors write in the April issue of the journal Frontiers\
      \ in Ecology and Environment, much of the remaining natural habitat in the border\
      \ region of Texas happens to be on federal lands, which means that the Department\
      \ of Homeland Security can commandeer it in the name of national security if\
      \ it chooses. And thanks to the Real ID Act of 2005, DHS also has the power\
      \ the power to waive most environmental reviews when it wants to build border\
      \ walls.\n\nOver the years, as DHS has built 654 miles of barriers and wall\
      \ on the border, it has sliced and diced land set aside for shrinking populations\
      \ of wildlife.\n\nIn the Rio Grande Valley, the 70 miles of existing wall go\
      \ through the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Southmost Preserve, several state Wildlife\
      \ Management Areas, sections of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Laguna Atascosa\
      \ National Wildlife Refuges, and Audubon\u2019s Sabal Palm Sanctuary, Audubon\
      \ magazine has reported. And natural areas continue to be at risk of border\
      \ walls being built across them.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that when DHS signaled\
      \ in 2017 it was eyeing the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, Texas,\
      \ for 3 miles of new wall, environmental groups went on defense. Over the past\
      \ several months, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Wildlife Corridor lobbied\
      \ and held protests over the significant harm this wall would bring to the wildlife\
      \ and overall ecology in the refuge.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service calls\
      \ Santa Ana the \u201Ccrown jewel\u201D of its 560 refuges in the US.\n\nWhat\
      \ a visit to the refuge revealed about how sensitive wildlife is to construction\n\
      \nEarlier this month, my colleague Christophe Haubursin and I went down to see\
      \ for ourselves. Our arrival coincided with the very end of winter, which meant\
      \ we got to see many birds on the move. Santa Ana is located at an east-west\
      \ and north-south confluence of two major migratory routes of birds flying from\
      \ as far north as Canada to as far south as Central America. It\u2019s also\
      \ the northernmost point for birds whose range extends all the way into South\
      \ America, a Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson told me.\n\nThe abundant\
      \ berries, insects, and wetlands in the refuge attract around 400 regular bird\
      \ residents. And more than 500 of the 1,000 bird species known to inhabit the\
      \ United States have been sighted there. \u201CIts unique geography means birders\
      \ who go there get the best of all worlds,\u201D Steve Holmer, vice president\
      \ of policy at the American Bird Conservancy, told me. \u201CIt\u2019s a special,\
      \ special place.\u201D\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the birds that make it special\
      \ \u2014 rare plants and reptiles like the endangered indigo snake can find\
      \ safe harbor in the refuge too. (The Rio Grande Valley region is native habitat\
      \ for the endangered ocelot cat, and there are about 50 left in the entire US.\
      \ Most are in the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge; the last official\
      \ sighting of one in the Santa Ana refuge was in 1992.)\n\nThough most birds\
      \ could theoretically fly over a wall, the big concern is that the wall would\
      \ destroy some of their habitat and put other species at risk of drowning the\
      \ next time the Rio Grande floods. (Right now the reptiles and mammals that\
      \ can\u2019t fly can crawl over the levee that runs through the refuge when\
      \ the river floods.)\n\nBut to many activists\u2019 surprise, the pushback against\
      \ building the wall in the refuge paid off: Congress included special language\
      \ in the spending bill to exempt it.\n\n\u201CIt was something that I fought\
      \ for,\u201D Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said in an interview. \u201CThanks to\
      \ the Democrats on the Appropriations Committee, this has been a priority to\
      \ protect the environmentally sensitive areas.\u201D\n\nExcept Congress allocated\
      \ $1.6 billion for more border wall \u2014 $445 million for 25 miles in Hidalgo\
      \ County and $196 million for 8 miles in Starr County \u2014 which are slated\
      \ to impact several other critical protected areas for wildlife. (An additional\
      \ $251 million was allocated to replace 14 miles of existing secondary wall\
      \ in the San Diego sector and $445 million was included to replace an unspecified\
      \ amount of other wall.)\n\n\u201CI was worried about this: that Santa Ana would\
      \ be saved and everyone else gets wall,\u201D said Jim Chapman, a Texas environmentalist\
      \ who helped organize against the Santa Ana wall. \u201CWe never wanted to just\
      \ save Santa Ana. It\u2019s kind of bittersweet.\u201D\n\nThe spending bill\
      \ authorizes money for a wall that would go through other protected areas\n\n\
      While the spending bill doesn\u2019t lay out the precise details of where the\
      \ new sections of wall will go, lawmakers and DHS officials have given several\
      \ clues as to their intentions.\n\nThe picture that has emerged from plans shared\
      \ with the local press is that the new 33 miles of wall will connect existing\
      \ sections in Hidalgo and Starr counties. And it turns out a lot of it will\
      \ go through land that\u2019s already been protected for wildlife in one form\
      \ or another.\n\nKersten, the local activist, has been looking at all the Rio\
      \ Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge tracts, state properties, county parks,\
      \ and private nonprofit nature sites that would be affected by the proposed,\
      \ funded border walls for Hidalgo County. And she\u2019s compiled an astonishing\
      \ list that include, among other sites:\n\nLa Parida Banco Refuge Tract (447\
      \ acres)\n\nBentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (797 acres)\n\nEl Morillo Banco\
      \ Refuge Tract (654 acres)\n\nNational Butterfly Center (100 acres)\n\nCottam\
      \ Refuge Tract (1,037 acres)\n\nPharr Settling Basin (720 acres)\n\nMilagro\
      \ Refuge Tract (846 acres)\n\nMarinoff Refuge Tract (432 acres)\n\nThat means\
      \ the total nature space affected by the proposed, funded walls would be more\
      \ than 6,500 acres in Hidalgo County, according to Kersten\u2019s calculations.\
      \ (The location of the 8 miles of wall in Starr County is still undetermined.)\n\
      \nAmong the most visited natural areas in Hidalgo County is the National Butterfly\
      \ Center in Mission, Texas. It\u2019s a 100-acre wildlife center and botanical\
      \ garden run by the North American Butterfly Association.\n\nPlans suggest the\
      \ proposed wall would go right through it, though Jeffrey Glassberg, the president\
      \ of the center, says he hasn\u2019t heard a word from the government about\
      \ its intention to build through the center.\n\n\u201CThis is complicated \u2014\
      \ it is not clear to me what this legislation authorizes or requires,\u201D\
      \ he said. \u201CBut they would have to exercise eminent domain to build a wall\
      \ through it.\u201D\n\nA wall would certainly destroy the little remaining butterfly\
      \ habitat at the center, he said. And it would further erode the region\u2019\
      s ecotourism. Look no further than what happened at Audubon\u2019s Sabal Palm\
      \ Sanctuary once a border wall was built through it: Visits fell by half because\
      \ the wall made it a much less pleasant place to be, according to Glassberg.\n\
      \nBorder fences have been terrible for wildlife and plants in other areas of\
      \ the border\n\nThe 654 miles of existing barriers and walls \u2014 built with\
      \ materials ranging from barbed wire to steel, bollard to wire mesh, and chain\
      \ link \u2014 have already been a disaster for the unique and sensitive ecosystems\
      \ and wildlife on the border.\n\nNot many scientists have measured the full\
      \ impact of fences on biodiversity on the border. One of the few studies to\
      \ tackle these questions was written by Jesse Lasky, a biologist at Penn State\
      \ who has studied the impact of border fences on border species, with his co-authors\
      \ in 2011. They estimated that 134 mammal, 178 reptile, and 57 amphibian species\
      \ live within about 30 miles of the line. Of those, 50 species and three subspecies\
      \ are globally or federally threatened in Mexico or the United States. And they\
      \ survive only because people on both sides have worked hard to conserve them.\n\
      \nThough the new sections of wall are officially funded, it could be years before\
      \ construction begins. And Rep. Cuellar told me that if the Democrats retake\
      \ the House and the Senate in the midterm elections, there\u2019s a chance the\
      \ wall won\u2019t happen at all.\n\nBut any new wall in the region is a threat.\
      \ \u201CMany plant and animal species dependent on this ecosystem would lose\
      \ some of their last remaining US habitat,\u201D as the Texas biologists wrote\
      \ in Frontiers in Ecology and Environment.\n\nIn the meantime, Cuellar says\
      \ he\u2019s trying to get the National Butterfly Center and the Bentsen-Rio\
      \ Grande Valley State Park exempted from wall construction."

    text: "\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III departs after a meeting on Capitol\
      \ Hill on June 21. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller\
      \ III's investigation just drew what appears to be its most direct line to date\
      \ between President Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nThat line is drawn\
      \ in a new court filing related to the upcoming sentencing of London attorney\
      \ Alex van der Zwaan. Van der Zwaan has pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts\
      \ with deputy Trump campaign manager Rick Gates and a person identified in the\
      \ document only as \"Person A.\" Person A appears to be a former Ukraine-based\
      \ aide to Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort named Konstantin\
      \ Kilimnik.\n\nHere's the paragraph:\n\nFourth, the lies and withholding of\
      \ documents were material to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office\u2019s investigation.\
      \ That Gates and Person A were directly communicating in September and October\
      \ 2016 was pertinent to the investigation. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special\
      \ Agents assisting the Special Counsel\u2019s Office assess that Person A has\
      \ ties to Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016. During his\
      \ first interview with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, van der Zwaan admitted\
      \ that he knew of that connection, stating that Gates told him Person A was\
      \ a former Russian Intelligence Officer with GRU.\n\nThat Person A has had ties\
      \ to Russian intelligence is not terribly surprising. Kilimnik's personal history\
      \ has been examined extensively by the media, including The Washington Post.\
      \ He has denied being involved in Russian intelligence, but he served in the\
      \ Russian military and attended a Russian military foreign language university\
      \ that is seen as a breeding ground for intelligence agents.\n\nWhat's particularly\
      \ significant in the Mueller filing, though, are six words: \u201Cand had such\
      \ ties in 2016.\u201D Prosecutors have said previously that a longtime Manafort\
      \ and Gates associate had ties to Russian intelligence, but they have never\
      \ said those ties remained during the 2016 campaign. In December, they said\
      \ this associate was \u201Ca longtime Russian colleague . . . who is currently\
      \ based in Russia and assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service.\u201D\
      \ Why those six words were added in this filing when they didn't appear in the\
      \ previous filing is the $64,000 question.\n\nAs Philip Bump details here, this\
      \ is hardly the first public indication of a link between the Trump campaign\
      \ and Russia, but it is the closest connection Mueller has made in a filing\
      \ to this point. Mueller hasn't weighed in on the alleged Kremlin ties of the\
      \ Russian lawyer Donald Trump Jr. met with, for instance, nor has he filed anything\
      \ involving Roger Stone's contacts with hackers who have been linked to Russia.\n\
      \nThe other new piece here is that Mueller's team says Gates described Person\
      \ A (again, apparently Kilimnik) as \u201Ca former Russian Intelligence Officer\
      \ with GRU.\u201D (GRU is Russia's military intelligence organization.) So according\
      \ to van der Zwaan, Gates talked openly about Person A's ties to Russian intelligence.\
      \ Kilimnik told The Post in June that he has \u201Cno relation to the Russian\
      \ or any other intelligence service.\u201D Mueller is now apparently directly\
      \ disputing that using Gates's own words, via van der Zwaan.\n\nEver since his\
      \ guilty plea last month, van der Zwaan's relation to the case has been unclear.\
      \ We know he is the son-in-law of a prominent Russian Ukrainian banker, but\
      \ as with other figures in this case, we have no idea why he lied to investigators.\
      \ Was it an honest mistake, or was he covering something up?\n\nThe new van\
      \ der Zwaan filing doesn't shed a whole bunch of new light on that, but it does\
      \ suggest that Mueller views Kilimnik as a possible link between the Trump campaign\
      \ and Russia, and that he believes Kilimnik hasn't been forthcoming about his\
      \ ties to Russian intelligence. We also know that Manafort had been in contact\
      \ with Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign, meeting him at least twice and asking\
      \ him to provide private briefings about the 2016 election to Oleg Deripaska,\
      \ a Russian oligarch who is closely tied to Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhether that's\
      \ pertinent to the broader collusion investigation is something we'll have to\
      \ wait to find out. There is so much Mueller knows that we simply don't; this\
      \ could be the tip of an iceberg or an extraneous fact. But those six words\
      \ do seem at least a little conspicuous."

      President Trump on Wednesday tweeted that he had been briefed about "the start
      of our Southern Border WALL" and included pictures depicting construction for
      the project, but there was one slight problem with the announcement.


      Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!


      The images tweeted by the president were not of his long-promised wall, but
      a months-long project to replace existing portions of a wall along Calexico,
      California.


      The project, which started in 2009, will replace a 2.25-mile section in the
      California-Mexico border wall, according to a statement last month from US Customs
      and Border Protection.


      The original wall in that section, built in the 1990s, had been built from recycled
      metal scraps and old landing mat materials, the agency said.


      "Although the existing wall has proven effective at deterring unlawful cross
      border activity, smuggling organizations damaged and breached this outdated
      version of a border wall several hundred times during the last two years," CBP
      said.


      The project will replace the old wall with a 30-foot-high, bollard-style structure.


      A DHS official told BuzzFeed News that Trump did meet with Homeland Security
      Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner
      Kevin McAleenan on Wednesday afternoon, but did not provide details of the briefing.


      The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump''s
      tweet, or his briefing with DHS officials.'

    text: 'Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is now betting his future
      on a presidential pardon, legal sources with knowledge of his strategy tell
      CBS News'' Paula Reid. According to the sources, Manafort is not planning to
      cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and and will fight the charges
      through to trial.


      It is unlikely that Manafort will escape conviction now that his co-defendant
      Richard Gates has agreed to work with the special counsel and the charges against
      him are no longer focused on rarely-prosecuted legal infractions involving the
      Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).


      Manafort was originally charged with money laundering and making false statements
      to investigators. Last month, after Gates pleaded guilty to two counts, the
      special counsel also charged Manafort with secretly paying European politicians
      to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.


      But Manafort expects that the president would grant him a pardon. Legal sources
      close to the case -- but not representing Manafort -- believe that is a reasonable
      expectation.'

      an extended grilling over President Donald Trump''s health and cognitive fitness
      played a part in his nomination for secretary of Veterans Affairs, a White House
      official told CNN Wednesday.


      The official said Trump liked the way Jackson handled himself with reporters
      during the briefing in January.


      Trump''s selection of Jackson, his personal physician, to replace Veterans Affairs
      Secretary David Shulkin immediately raised questions about Jackson''s experience
      and qualifications, according to multiple veterans groups and Capitol Hill sources.


      Asked how Jackson is qualified to oversee medical care for US veterans, the
      White House official noted Jackson brings with him both a medical and military
      background to the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as past praise for
      his work in previous administrations.


      The decision to nominate Jackson to run the government''s second largest department
      surprised members of Congress, veteran advocacy groups and officials within
      the department, the sources told CNN.

      s presidential campaign colluded with Russia have been questioning witnesses\
      \ about events at the 2016 Republican National Convention, according to two\
      \ sources familiar with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiries.\n\n\

      \ Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. July 21, 2016. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\
      \nMueller\u2019s team has been asking about a convention-related event attended\
      \ by both Russia\u2019s U.S. ambassador and Jeff Sessions, the first U.S. senator\
      \ to support Trump and now his attorney general, said one source, who requested\
      \ anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAnother issue Mueller\u2019\
      s team has been asking about is how and why Republican Party platform language\
      \ hostile to Russia was deleted from a section of the document related to Ukraine,\
      \ said another source who also requested anonymity.\n\nMueller\u2019s interest\
      \ in what happened at the Republican convention in Cleveland, Ohio in July 2016,\
      \ is an indication that Trump campaign contacts and actions related to Russia\
      \ remain central to the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nTrump, who\
      \ was nominated as the Republican Party candidate for the November 2016 election\
      \ during the convention, has denied any collusion with Russia during the campaign.\
      \ Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 findings that it interfered\
      \ in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nInvestigators\
      \ have asked detailed questions about conversations that Sessions, then a Trump\
      \ campaign adviser, had at a convention event attended by then-Russian Ambassador\
      \ to the United States Sergei Kislyak, said the first source, who was questioned\
      \ by Mueller about the event.\n\nThe same source said Mueller\u2019s team also\
      \ has been asking whether Sessions had private discussions with Kislyak on the\
      \ sidelines of a campaign speech Trump gave at Washington\u2019s Mayflower Hotel\
      \ in April 2016.\n\nSessions\u2019 spokespersons have denied repeatedly that\
      \ he had any private discussions with Kislyak at the Mayflower. Sessions told\
      \ lawmakers last year he could not recall any conversations with Russian officials\
      \ at the hotel but could not rule out that a \u201Cbrief interaction\u201D with\
      \ Kislyak may have occurred there.\n\nSpokespersons for Mueller and Sessions\

      \nUKRAINE LANGUAGE\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s investigators have also interviewed\
      \ attendees of the committee meetings that drafted the Republican Party platform\
      \ in Cleveland.\n\nAt one committee meeting, according to people in attendance,\
      \ Diana Denman, a member of the platform committee\u2019s national security\
      \ subcommittee, proposed language calling for the United States to supply \u201C\
      lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and greater coordination\
      \ with NATO on defense planning.\u201D\n\nBut the final platform language deleted\
      \ the reference to \u201Clethal defensive weapons,\u201D a change that made\
      \ the platform less hostile to Russia, whose troops had invaded the Crimean\
      \ peninsula and eastern Ukraine.\n\nAfter the convention, Denman told Reuters\
      \ in 2016, J.D. Gordon, a Trump foreign policy adviser, told her he was going\
      \ to speak to Trump about the language on Ukraine, and that Trump\u2019s campaign\
      \ team played a direct role in softening the platform language.\n\nThe Trump\
      \ campaign has denied playing any role in the weakening of the party\u2019s\
      \ position regarding Ukraine. Gordon has called Denman\u2019s version of events\
      \ \u201Cinaccurate.\u201D\n\nStephen Yates, co-chair of the platform committee\u2019\
      s national security subcommittee, said he has \u201Cheard nothing about other\

    text: '(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller''s team last year made clear it wanted
      former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates'' help, not so much against his former
      business partner Paul Manafort, but with its central mission: investigating
      the Trump campaign''s contact with the Russians. New information disclosed in
      court filings and to CNN this week begin to show how they''re getting it.


      In a court filing earlier this week, the public saw the first signs of how the
      Mueller team plans to use information from Gates to tie Manafort, the former
      Trump campaign chairman, directly to a Russian intelligence agency. Mueller''s
      team alleges that Gates was in contact with a close colleague of Manafort''s
      who worked for a Russian intelligence agency -- and that Gates knew of the spy
      service ties in September and October 2016, while he worked on the Trump campaign.
      Gates would have to talk about the communication with the man if prosecutors
      wanted, according to his plea deal.


      That''s in line with what prosecutors told Gates months ago during high-stakes
      negotiations, CNN has learned. They told him they didn''t need his cooperation
      against Manafort, according to a person familiar with the investigation, and
      instead wanted to hear what he knew about contact between the Trump campaign
      and Russians.


      The extent of Gates'' knowledge about any such contact or what he told prosecutors
      hasn''t been made public.


      As part of Gates'' agreement to cooperate with the special counsel a month ago,
      he earned a vastly reduced potential sentence and had several charges dropped
      in two criminal cases against him.


      Gates'' plea also adds to mounting pressure on his co-defendant Manafort --
      who so far the government is making a central player in the investigation --
      to change his plea and potentially help investigators. Under his plea agreement,
      Gates still could be called to testify against Manafort.


      Mueller''s court filing Tuesday night, in a separate case for a lawyer whose
      firm did legal work for Gates and Manafort, made public the most direct effort
      yet by Mueller''s team to draw a line between Manafort and the Trump campaign
      to Russian operatives. Prosecutors called the details of Gates'' contact with
      the Russian intelligence officer during the campaign "pertinent to the investigation."


      Russian contact


      The alleged Russian intelligence agent, referred to as "Person A" in the court
      filing, appears to be Konstantin Kilimnik, a former employee who worked with
      Manafort''s firm and lived in Kiev and Moscow, according to sources familiar
      with the investigation. In December, the Mueller prosecutors made a similar
      unnamed reference to Kilimnik, saying he is "assessed to have ties to a Russian
      intelligence service." That was related to a Kiev newspaper op-ed that Kilimnik
      helped edit in consultation with Manafort late last year, which prosecutors
      said could violate a court-imposed gag order on Manafort.


      The criminal allegations facing Gates and Manafort encompass work they did in
      the years prior to the 2016 election. Manafort has pleaded not guilty in two
      federal criminal cases stemming from Mueller''s prosecution, one in Washington,
      DC, and another one in Virginia.


      A chief criticism from President Donald Trump and his defenders has been that
      the charges brought so far by the special counsel don''t relate directly to
      Mueller''s central mission investigating possible illegal coordination between
      the Trump campaign and the Russian government, which the President and others
      often shorthand using the term collusion. The accusation related to Kilimnik
      and ties to Russian intelligence, made in Mueller''s Tuesday filing, begins
      to answer that criticism, but so far without actually making the charge in Manafort''s
      case.


      A lawyer for Manafort declined to comment. Kilimnik didn''t comment. Last year,
      Kilimnik told The Washington Post he has "no relation to the Russian or any
      other intelligence service."


      Gates'' current lawyer also declined to comment for this story.


      What Gates knows


      Gates may have information of value to prosecutors beyond his business dealings
      with Manafort, according to sources familiar with his role. He never grew close
      to Trump, but he had ties with other members of Trump''s inner circle, including
      Manafort and Tom Barrack, a fundraiser and close friend of Trump''s. He also
      developed a reputation for keeping tabs on what others were up to, one source
      said.


      Gates worked alongside Manafort during the critical summer of 2016 when senior
      campaign officials, including Manafort, met at Trump Tower in New York with
      a group of Russians who had promised damaging information on Democratic nominee
      Hillary Clinton.


      "Was he in the strategy meetings? No. But he was an implementer," one person
      said of Gates. So while he may not have participated in the Trump Tower meeting
      with the Russians, he may still have knowledge of the meeting or whether those
      Russians were ever introduced to Trump himself.


      "He would be the kind of person who would probably know that," this person said.


      Even after Manafort was fired from the campaign, Gates stuck around. He then
      went on to work with Barrack, while Barrack ran the presidential inaugural committee
      following the election.


      Legal team troubles


      Before the indictment, prosecutors had told Gates he faced the risk of criminal
      charges -- the beginning of a strategy to pressure him, according to two sources.


      Gates'' various legal teams -- and there have been many -- kept in touch with
      Mueller''s office throughout the investigation.


      Once prosecutors made a plea offer following Gates'' indictment, that offer
      never changed: He could plead guilty to a conspiracy count if he helped the
      investigation.


      In all, Gates held out for almost four months. He initially pleaded not guilty
      with the help of a public defender after he split with his previous attorney.


      He then hired three lawyers, who each worked in their own small firms, to take
      him to trial.


      But the financial stress on Gates mounted. He failed to pay some of his legal
      bills.


      "The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and
      the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much," Gates told
      friends and family in an email the morning he pleaded guilty.


      Despite the risk for Manafort and the cost, Gates engaged a third set of private
      attorneys, led by Thomas Green of the large law firm Sidley Austin, to negotiate
      his plea deal with Mueller in January and February.


      Even as Green finalized Gates'' plea throughout February, Gates wavered on his
      willingness to cooperate with the prosecutors. For months, he held on-and-off
      conversations with a fourth option for a private defense attorney to take him
      to trial: Barry Pollack. Pollack had previously worked closely with Manafort''s
      attorneys.


      At least three other well-known criminal defense law firms tried to help Gates
      over the past several months, according to multiple sources. One law partner
      made calls to find him lawyers, another two lawyers reviewed the financial allegations,
      and a third firm offered to get involved. Manafort''s attorneys were engaged
      in some of the efforts but not all.


      More recently, outside lawyers created a legal defense fund to help defendants
      in the Mueller investigation fight their charges.


      Yet it wasn''t enough. Gates never hired Pollack nor any other attorney to take
      him to trial after he was released from house arrest in early January.


      Prosecutors revealed after one of his interviews with the Mueller team, on February
      1, that they believed he had lied to them about a detail of Manafort''s lobbying
      efforts. The lie resulted in a second charge added to his possible plea. Gates
      chose to cooperate and plead guilty eight days later.


      CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that a legal defense
      fund to help defendants in the Mueller investigation was created by outside
      lawyers, not the Republican National Committee.'

      \n\nIn a separate prong of the ruling, Judge Garaufis said that the decision\

      \ law that bars the government from repealing policies arbitrarily, capriciously\

      \nJessica Hanson, a lawyer for the National Immigration Law Center, said that\

    text: "\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on March 28. (Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP/Getty\
      \ Images)\n\nAnders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, is writing\
      \ a book about Russia\u2019s crony capitalism.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister\
      \ Theresa May\u2019s initial response to the attack with a nerve agent in England\
      \ was old-school. She expelled 23 Russian diplomats, allowing Moscow to expel\
      \ the same number of British diplomats and close the British Council and a British\
      \ Consulate in Russia.\n\nThe joint Western action of 27 additional countries\
      \ expelling Russian intelligence agents on March 26 added new force to the retaliation,\
      \ but President Vladimir Putin can shrug this off. He is likely to expel a similar\
      \ number of diplomats from all the countries involved. What would be even better\
      \ is a crackdown on Kremlin money in the West \u2014 and the best place to start\
      \ is by taking on the problem of anonymous ownership. The West should go after\
      \ the money that the Putin regime has moved here.\n\nRussia\u2019s economic\
      \ means are limited. Therefore, the Kremlin prefers cheap asymmetric or hybrid\
      \ warfare, such as the hacking of elections, cyberwarfare, manipulation of social\
      \ media and the corruption of foreign politicians. We need to respond asymmetrically,\
      \ hurting the Kremlin more than it hurts us.\n\nPutin controls the Russian state\
      \ institutions, its secret police and its big state companies. Together with\
      \ a few old friends from St. Petersburg, the president is tapping the big state\
      \ companies through overpriced no-bid procurement, transfer pricing, asset stripping\
      \ and stock manipulation. They are also making money by extorting old oligarchs\
      \ and taking loans from state banks, not to be returned.\n\nBoris Nemtsov, who\
      \ was murdered outside of the Kremlin, and still-active opposition politician\
      \ Vladimir Milov exposed this kleptocracy in their booklet \u201CPutin and Gazprom\u201D\
      \ in 2008. A more extensive account in English is Karen Dawisha\u2019s book\
      \ \u201CPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia?\u201D The Panama Papers,\
      \ a series of leaked documents on offshore accounts released in April 2016,\
      \ offered plenty of evidence of Putin\u2019s secret wealth.\n\nOverall assessments\
      \ indicate a personal enrichment of Putin and his closest cronies of some $20\
      \ billion to $25 billion a year since 2006. Nemtsov and Milov documented pilfering\
      \ from Gazprom of $60 billion from 2004 to 2007, and this was probably just\
      \ over half of their enrichment, which has only increased. By now, this group\
      \ would have accumulated $240 billion to $300 billion. Businessman Bill Browder\
      \ estimates that Putin is the richest man in the world, with a personal wealth\
      \ of $200 billion. Total private Russian holdings abroad are assessed in the\
      \ range of $800 billion to $1.3 trillion, according to Global Financial Integrity\
      \ and a National Bureau of Economic Research study.\n\nPutin and his friends\
      \ have not accumulated their vast fortunes to consume them, but rather, to maintain\
      \ power in Russia. The irony is that having undermined property rights in Russia,\
      \ they \u2014 like other Russians \u2014 can only safeguard their savings abroad\
      \ in countries that enjoy the rule of law, allow anonymous ownership and have\
      \ sufficient financial depth for their vast fortunes.\n\nMany countries have\
      \ the rule of law, but just a few of them \u2014 those with Anglo-American law\
      \ \u2014 allow large-scale anonymous ownership. Most European countries do not.\
      \ Numerous small islands allow anonymous ownership, but they lack financial\
      \ depth. Only two countries can harbor most of the Russian offshore wealth \u2014\
      \ the United States and Britain \u2014 because they allow anonymous investment\
      \ in real estate on a large scale.\n\nTwenty-nine countries, including most\
      \ E.U. countries, already demand full disclosure of beneficiary owners, and\
      \ 11 others have agreed to do so, too. They have all come to the same conclusion:\
      \ Anonymous ownership has become a major threat to national security. Prime\
      \ Minister David Cameron promised to demand full disclosure in May 2016, but\
      \ he resigned two months later, and his successor, May, has shown no interest\
      \ in doing so even after the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury.\n\nThe United\
      \ States needs to catch up. Congress is currently considering two bills that\
      \ go in the right direction. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has submitted\
      \ a draft of the True Incorporation Transparency for Law Enforcement Act for\
      \ corporate transparency, and in the House of Representatives the Counter Terrorism\
      \ and Illicit Finance Act has been submitted. Congress should adopt one of these\
      \ bills. The important thing is to unearth secret ownership by sanctioned individuals\
      \ and entities.\n\nHelpfully, Putin has himself told us what sanctions hurt\
      \ him the most by complaining incessantly about the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of\
      \ Law Accountability Act of 2012 and the sanctioning of his St. Petersburg cronies\
      \ in March 2014 for their role in Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea. These\
      \ acts prohibit named individuals from entering the territory of the United\
      \ States and freeze their assets whenever they are detected. So far, unfortunately,\
      \ these new laws haven\u2019t proved especially effective, since the U.S. government\
      \ has detected only a few million dollars of their assets.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S.\
      \ treasury assessed that $300 billion a year was laundered in the United States.\
      \ According to Raymond Baker, founder of Global Financial Integrity, in a good\
      \ year, the U.S. government detects 0.1 percent of that money. The reason? Anonymous\
      \ companies are allowed to invest in this country. The same is true of Britain,\
      \ where the National Crime Agency estimates that $125 billion is laundered annually.\
      \ This must be stopped for the sake of national security.\n\nThe best British\
      \ and American asymmetric response to the Kremlin\u2019s hybrid warfare is to\
      \ unearth the holdings of Putin and his sanctioned friends in our countries\
      \ and freeze them."

    text: "THE MORNING PLUM:\n\n\u201CWe will always take care of our GREAT VETERANS,\u201D\
      \ President Trump promised us last summer, and now they\u2019re back in the\
      \ news again. Trump has replaced his chief of the Department of Veterans Affairs\
      \ with his personal physician, a man with no management experience who will\
      \ be responsible for dealing with the VA\u2019s chronic management struggles.\
      \ This means more attention to the plight of our GREAT VETERANS and the question\
      \ of how the Trump administration is treating them.\n\nWhich provides an occasion\
      \ to look at another trend that the Trump era has produced: A lot of our GREAT\
      \ VETERANS are running for House seats \u2014 as Democrats.\n\nThis important\
      \ story is related to another big development with potentially far-reaching\
      \ consequences: the shift of millennials toward the Democratic Party, and the\
      \ apparent role of the two most recent GOP presidencies \u2014 those of Trump\
      \ and George W. Bush \u2014 in making that happen.\n\nPolitico has an excellent\
      \ piece of reporting on all the veterans who are running as Democratic House\
      \ candidates around the country. To be sure, veterans do tend to lean heavily\
      \ towards the GOP, and many veterans are running as Republicans, but as Politico\
      \ notes, one count by a veterans\u2019 group shows that a bare majority of the\
      \ veterans who have run for Congress in this cycle have done so as Democrats.\
      \ The point is that this group is unexpectedly large.\n\nAs Politico\u2019s\
      \ piece shows, a good number of the veterans who are running as Democrats served\
      \ in either Iraq or Afghanistan, or both, and some were prompted to serve by\
      \ the 9/11 attacks. Some of them have been driven to run by the excesses of\
      \ the five-time draft-deferrer in the White House and the failures of the GOP-controlled\
      \ Congress:\n\nThe candidates are presenting themselves both as a moral rebuke\
      \ to what they see as Donald Trump\u2019s self-promoting divisiveness and also\
      \ as a practical solution to the failure of the nation\u2019s highest legislative\
      \ body to get anything done.\n\nAnd Politico reports that the combination of\
      \ having served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, and seeing the rise of Trump at\
      \ home, has created \u201Cdeep reservations\u201D about the direction of the\
      \ country, prompting the veterans to try to get involved in public service.\
      \ (The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee counts more than 40 candidates\
      \ who are veterans, around 20 in top-tier contests.)\n\nImportantly, many of\
      \ these candidates are millennials, and in this sense, this trend may be part\
      \ of a bigger story. A recent Pew study found that nearly 6 in 10 millennials\
      \ now identify with the Democratic Party, more than any other age group. A solid\
      \ majority of millennials have liberal views. Only 27 percent of millennials\
      \ approve of Trump, and millennials have beliefs that are at odds with key tenets\
      \ of Trumpism: Large majorities of them say immigrants strengthen the country\
      \ and believe that diplomacy, not military force, is the key to maintaining\
      \ strength.\n\nIn the case of millennial veterans running as Democrats, it\u2019\
      s plausible that this represents a reaction of sorts to both of the past two\
      \ GOP presidencies. Older millennials served in George W. Bush\u2019s wars \u2014\
      \ which radicalized young voters, as evidenced by Barack Obama\u2019s victory\
      \ powered by them \u2014 and now that the Trump presidency is further alienating\
      \ that generation, many are trying to enter public service. Meanwhile, younger\
      \ millennials with dimmer memories of the Bush years may also be getting driven\
      \ toward the Democratic Party by Trump\u2019s excesses.\n\nDemocratic strategist\
      \ Simon Rosenberg suggests that this new crop of candidates \u2014 and the move\
      \ of millennials toward the Democratic Party \u2014 could represent the kind\
      \ of front end of a transformation of the party away from older leaders, such\
      \ as Obama and Nancy Pelosi, and toward a newer generation of civic-minded millennial\
      \ would-be public servants. Conor Lamb\u2019s surprise victory in a Pennsylvania\
      \ district Trump carried by 20 points is a case in point.\n\n\u201CConor Lamb\
      \ ran as a responsible civic leader, someone who served in the military and\
      \ was a prosecutor,\u201D Rosenberg told me. \u201CThis civic ethos is very\
      \ powerful with Democrats running in 2018. The recklessness of the Bush and\
      \ Trump presidencies has driven two waves of young people away from Republicans\
      \ and towards the Democrats. Bush\u2019s response to 9/11 meant millennials\
      \ had to serve in his failed wars. Now the Trump presidency is creating its\
      \ own backlash.\u201D\n\nMillennials will soon become the largest voting bloc\
      \ in the United States. And behind this, of course, lies the post-millennial\
      \ wave, whose political coming of age is being powerfully demonstrated by the\
      \ Parkland protests, which also plainly represent a reaction to Trump. Whatever\
      \ happens in the 2018 battle for the House, big trends are currently gathering\
      \ that could have a lasting effect on our politics for years to come.\n\n* MUELLER\
      \ IS SCRUTINIZING TALK OF PARDONS: Last night we learned that Trump\u2019s lawyer\
      \ John Dowd floated possible pardons of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. The\
      \ New York Times\u2019s story also contains this:\n\nDuring interviews with\
      \ Mr. [Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s] investigators in recent months, current\
      \ and former administration officials have recounted conversations they had\
      \ with the president about potential pardons for former aides under investigation\
      \ by the special counsel, according to two people briefed on the interviews.\n\
      \nIn one meeting, Trump asked about the extent of his pardon power; in another,\
      \ he raised the possibility of pardoning Flynn. Plainly, Mueller is looking\
      \ at possible obstruction of justice.\n\n* PARDON OFFERS COULD BE OBSTRUCTION:\
      \ The Post also reports that Dowd privately floated pardons and that Trump privately\
      \ expressed a \u201Ckeen interest last spring in his power to pardon.\u201D\
      \ And:\n\nLegal experts said prosecutors could view floating the idea of a presidential\
      \ pardon to people under investigation as a criminal effort to obstruct justice.\
      \ Raising such a possibility could be considered an incentive for witnesses\
      \ not to cooperate with investigators.\n\nIn other words, even if the president\
      \ has quasi-absolute power to pardon, the floating of that possibility to get\
      \ associates not to plead guilty and spill could be the problem.\n\n* GENERIC\
      \ BALLOT TIGHTENS: A new CNN poll finds that the Democrats\u2019 advantage in\
      \ the generic House ballot matchup has narrowed to six points, 50-44. But there\u2019\
      s also this:\n\nAbout half \u2014 51% \u2014 of Democrats and Democratic-leaning\
      \ independents say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for\
      \ Congress in November, compared with just 36% among Republicans and Republican-leaning\
      \ independents. \u2026 voters who are deeply enthusiastic about voting give\
      \ Democrats a better than 20-point lead.\n\nDemocrats need a large spread to\
      \ overcome GOP structural advantages such as gerrymandering. There will be a\
      \ lot of hype every time these numbers tighten, but the enthusiasm edge will\
      \ also matter.\n\n* OPEN SEATS GIVE DEMOCRATS AN EDGE: The folks at Sabato\u2019\
      s Crystal Ball update their take on the House landscape and conclude:\n\nJust\
      \ 379 of 435 House districts will have incumbents running in them this November.\
      \ That\u2019s the second-lowest total of the post-World War II era. The 56 total\
      \ open districts include 37 open Republican-held seats and 19 open Democratic\
      \ seats. \u2026 the Democratic potential in these seats has grown: It\u2019\
      s possible the Democrats could get a third or more of the way toward flipping\
      \ the House just through netting gains among the open seats.\n\nAnd there may\
      \ be more retirements to come.\n\n* FIRED VETERANS AFFAIRS CHIEF FIGHTS BACK:\
      \ Trump fired David Shulkin, his head of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\
      \ and replaced him with his personal physician. Shulkin strikes back in a New\
      \ York Times op-ed:\n\nThe advocates within the administration for privatizing\
      \ V.A. health services \u2026 saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had\
      \ to be removed. That is because I am convinced that privatization is a political\
      \ issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if\
      \ it undermines care for veterans. \u2026 As I prepare to leave government,\
      \ I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your\
      \ country.\n\nOne imagines this will open the door to further reporting on what\
      \ really happened here.\n\n* CHINA WARNS U.S. ON TRADE: China today responded\
      \ to Trump\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on Chinese products with a warning\
      \ of its own:\n\nChina could target a broad range of U.S. businesses from agriculture\
      \ to aircraft, autos, semiconductors and even services if the trade conflict\
      \ escalates, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday.\
      \ \u2026 China\u2019s biggest U.S. imports are aircraft and related equipment,\
      \ soybeans and autos, with the total bill about $40 billion last year.\n\nRetaliatory\
      \ action on agricultural products could bite deep in Trump country. But this\
      \ kind of talk only encourages Trump, because it fuels his fantasies that this\
      \ is a standoff he can \u201Cwin.\u201D\n\n* AND REPUBLICANS CHEAT \u2026 AND\
      \ CHEAT \u2026 AND CHEAT: E.J. Dionne Jr. notes that the common thread connecting\
      \ two big controversies \u2014 the citizenship question added to the census,\
      \ and the court battle against gerrymanders \u2014 is Republican cheating:\n\
      \nThe undercounting of immigrants \u2026 would tilt representation \u2026 away\
      \ from places with large populations of Latinos and other immigrants (often\
      \ metropolitan and Democratic-leaning) and overrepresent white, rural regions\
      \ and states. \u2026 Because so many of the state legislatures that drew district\
      \ lines after the 2010 Census were controlled by Republicans, an end to gerrymandering\
      \ now would be especially challenging to the GOP.\n\nFunny how that works, isn\u2019\
      t it?"

      \ and \u201Cif he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live\
      \ to be 200 years old.\u201D\n\nWeirdly, Jackson\u2019s supreme confidence in\
      \ Trump\u2019s physical and mental health hasn\u2019t convinced veterans who\
      \ rely on the V.A. for their own health services. Per Stars and Stripes:\n\n\
      \u201CWe\u2019re highly concerned,\u201D AMVETS Director Joe Chenelly said.\
      \ \u201CWe don\u2019t know this guy.\u201D\n\nJohn Rowan, who leads Vietnam\
      \ Veterans of America, described Jackson as an \u201Cunknown quantity.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CThe only good thing is, he\u2019s a veteran and experienced with dealing\
      \ in warfare,\u201D Rowan said. \u201CThat\u2019s good. Whether he has administrative\
      \ experience or not, I don\u2019t know. Hardly anybody knows.\u201D\n\nOn Capitol\
      \ Hill, one Republican aide told The Washington Post that appointing Jackson\
      \ \u201Ccould be a disaster for vets,\u201D adding, \u201CWhat has this guy\

      Wray to investigate whether President Donald Trump''s son-in-law and senior
      White House aide Jared Kushner leaked classified information to Saudi Crown
      Prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to a letter obtained by CNN.


      The call comes after The Intercept, citing three sources, reported that the
      Saudi prince -- known casually by his initials, MBS -- told confidantes after
      their meeting last year that Kushner had discussed Saudi leaders who are disloyal
      to the crown prince.


      "We request the FBI open an immediate investigation to determine if these reports
      are accurate and to explore the extent to which information and sources may
      have been comprised," reads the letter from Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, Gerald
      Connolly, Donald Beyer, Pramila Jayapal, Peter Welch and Ruben Gallego.


      The letter notes that the "integrity of classified information" falls within
      the purview of the FBI but that "while the President has the authority to declassify
      and share information, the President''s advisers do not."


      According to The Intercept, one person "who talks frequently to confidants of
      the Saudi and Emirati rulers" told the publication that MBS bragged to United
      Arab Emirates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed that Kushner was "in his pocket."
      The publication added that the information on the Saudi royals not loyal to
      him was contained within the President''s Daily Brief, a document presented
      to the President every day that Kushner lost access to earlier this year when
      near security clearance rules were instituted by chief of staff John Kelly.

      \ war and kill people than another bully? It\u2019s difficult, after all, to\
      \ avoid the label \u2014 that of a bully \u2014 when thinking of John Bolton,\
      \ the former Bush administration official-turned-Fox News pundit who Trump recently\
      \ picked as his national security adviser.\n\n\u201CJohn Bolton is a bully,\u201D\
      \ Jos\xE9 Bustani, the retired Brazilian diplomat and former head of the Organization\
      \ for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, told me when I reached him by phone\
      \ in Paris earlier this month.\n\nThere are a number of people who claim to\
      \ have been bullied or intimidated by Bolton \u2014 including Bustani. The latter\u2019\
      s criticisms of the famously mustachioed hawk have been public for many years\
      \ now, but some of the details of his tense encounter with Bolton at the OPCW\
      \ have never been reported before in English.\n\nIn early 2002, a year before\
      \ the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration was putting intense pressure\
      \ on Bustani to quit as director-general of the OPCW \u2014 despite the fact\
      \ that he had been unanimously re-elected to head the 145-nation body just two\
      \ years earlier. His transgression? Negotiating with Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq\
      \ to allow OPCW weapons inspectors to make unannounced visits to that country\
      \ \u2014 thereby undermining Washington\u2019s rationale for regime change.\n\
      \nIn 2001, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell had penned a letter to Bustani,\
      \ thanking him for his \u201Cvery impressive\u201D work. By March 2002, however,\
      \ Bolton \u2014 then serving as under secretary of state for Arms Control and\
      \ International Security Affairs \u2014 arrived in person at the OPCW headquarters\
      \ in the Hague to issue a warning to the organization\u2019s chief. And, according\
      \ to Bustani, Bolton didn\u2019t mince words. \u201CCheney wants you out,\u201D\
      \ Bustani recalled Bolton saying, referring to the then-vice president of the\
      \ United States. \u201CWe can\u2019t accept your management style.\u201D\n\n\
      \u201CWe know where your kids live. You have two sons in New York.\u201D\n\n\
      Bolton continued, according to Bustani\u2019s recollections: \u201CYou have\
      \ 24 hours to leave the organization, and if you don\u2019t comply with this\
      \ decision by Washington, we have ways to retaliate against you.\u201D\n\nThere\
      \ was a pause.\n\n\u201CWe know where your kids live. You have two sons in New\
      \ York.\u201D\n\nBustani told me he was taken aback but refused to back down.\
      \ \u201CMy family is aware of the situation, and we are prepared to live with\
      \ the consequences of my decision,\u201D he replied.\n\nAfter hearing Bustani\u2019\
      s description of the encounter, I reached out to his son-in-law, Stewart Wood,\
      \ a British politician and former adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Wood\
      \ told me that he vividly remembers Bustani telling him about Bolton\u2019s\
      \ implicit threat to their family immediately after the meeting in the Hague.\
      \ \u201CIt instantly became an internal family meme,\u201D Wood recalled. Two\
      \ former OPCW colleagues of Bustani, Bob Rigg and Mikhail Berdennikov, have\
      \ also since confirmed via email that they remember their then-boss telling\
      \ them at the time about Bolton\u2019s not-so-subtle remark about his kids.\n\
      \nAnother former OPCW official, then-Special Assistant to the Director-General\
      \ for External Relations Gordon Vachon, who was in the room for the meeting\
      \ with Bolton, has confirmed that the Bush administration official implicitly\
      \ threatened Bustani. The OPCW chief \u201Ccould go quietly, with little fuss\
      \ and restraint on all sides and \u2018without dragging your name through the\
      \ mud,\u2019\u201D Vachon recalled Bolton saying, in an email to The Intercept.\
      \ \u201CI cannot say from memory that I heard Mr. Bolton mention DG Bustani\u2019\
      s children, probably because I was reeling from Mr. Bolton\u2019s thinly-veiled\
      \ threat to DG Bustani\u2019s reputation.\u201D\n\nI reached out to John Bolton\
      \ and the White House for a response to these allegations. Rather than issue\
      \ an outright denial, the White House responded via a press spokesperson that\
      \ referred me to a section of his 2008 memoir, \u201CSurrender is Not an Option:\
      \ Defending America at the United Nations,\u201D which deals with Bustani and\
      \ the OPCW. In the book, Bolton said the U.S. viewed Bustani as a \u201Cmanagement\
      \ disaster\u201D (without mentioning Powell\u2019s praise), but claims to have\
      \ offered him \u201Ca gracious and dignified exit\u201D \u2014 if, that is,\
      \ he went quietly.\n\nTo call Bolton\u2019s rhetoric undiplomatic is an understatement.\
      \ He visited Bustani in his capacity as a top U.S. State Department official,\
      \ yet his behavior was more thuggish. How on earth can a senior diplomat, representing\
      \ a democratic government, justify implicitly threatening the children of an\
      \ international official in order to win a political argument? How is such a\
      \ person now fit to hold the office of national security adviser \u2014 the\
      \ most senior position in the U.S. government that doesn\u2019t require an election\
      \ win or Senate confirmation?\n\n\u201CThe problem with this man is that he\u2019\
      s so ideological, so brutal; he doesn\u2019t open the door to dialogue,\u201D\
      \ the former OPCW chief told me on the phone. \u201CI don\u2019t know how people\
      \ can work for him.\u201D\n\nActivists gather on the west side of the Capitol\
      \ Building on June 7, 2005, in Washington, D.C., to protest the nomination of\
      \ John Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty\
      \ Images\n\nBolton\u2019s history of bullying, in fact, is well-documented.\
      \ Carl W. Ford Jr, the State Department\u2019s former intelligence chief, called\
      \ Bolton \u201Ca serial abuser\u201D of junior employees and \u201Ca quintessential\
      \ kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.\u201D Testifying before the Senate in 2005,\
      \ Ford discussed the case of Christian Westermann, the former chief bioweapons\
      \ analyst at the State Department who had refused to sign off on a speech accusing\
      \ Cuba of possessing a secret bioweapons program and had been \u201Cberated\u201D\
      \ by Bolton, who \u201Cthen tried to have him fired.\u201D\n\nMelody Townsel,\
      \ a former U.S. Agency for International Development contractor, said she was\
      \ harassed by the short-tempered Bolton, then a lawyer in the private sector,\
      \ on a visit to Kyrgyzstan in 1994: \u201CMr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through\
      \ the halls of a Russian hotel \u2014 throwing things at me, shoving threatening\
      \ letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman,\u201D she later\
      \ recalled, in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThe big\
      \ problem is that Bolton \u2014 the \u201Cmadman,\u201D the \u201Cserial abuser,\u201D\
      \ the \u201Cbully\u201D \u2014 happens to also be pretty effective at getting\
      \ things done.\n\nAccording to Time magazine, his former boss Colin Powell privately\
      \ warned Republican senators in 2005, during the confirmation hearings for Bolton\u2019\
      s controversial nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, that \u201C\
      he had been troubled by the way Bolton had treated subordinates who did not\
      \ agree with him.\u201D\n\nYet the big problem is that Bolton \u2014 the \u201C\
      madman,\u201D the \u201Cserial abuser,\u201D the \u201Cbully\u201D \u2014 happens\
      \ to also be pretty effective at getting things done. This is perhaps what makes\
      \ him so dangerous. Take the case of Bustani and the OPCW: Bolton succeeded\
      \ in having the Brazilian removed from his post. Only a few weeks after the\
      \ U.S. official\u2019s visit to the Hague, the OPCW chief was \u201Cpushed out\
      \ of office\u201D in an extraordinary meeting of the organization\u2019s member\
      \ countries (and in a decision, incidentally, that an administrative tribunal\
      \ of the International Labour Organization would later call \u201Cunlawful\u201D\
      ).\n\nBolton himself proudly recalled in his memoir how then-Sen. Joe Biden,\
      \ D-Del., criticized his views while praising his abilities during the 2001\
      \ congressional hearings to confirm him as under secretary of state. \u201C\
      My problem with you, over the years, has been, you\u2019re too competent,\u201D\
      \ Biden remarked, according to Bolton. \u201CI mean, I would rather you be stupid\
      \ and not very effective.\n\nNow, therefore, is the time to panic; now is the\
      \ moment to sound the alarm. The bullies have come together. The \u201Cideological\u201D\
      \ and \u201Cbrutal\u201D Bolton is about to be given a desk a few feet away\
      \ from the Oval Office. As national security adviser, he\u2019ll be the first\
      \ one in the room and the last one out. \u201CTrump is utterly ignorant of the\
      \ world, prone to making impulsive decisions, and tends to defer to the most\
      \ forceful voice in the room, especially when it conveys information with confident\
      \ bluster,\u201D observed Damon Linker in the The Week. \u201CThat would give\
      \ Bolton enormous power to shape policy \u2014 which means the power to get\
      \ the United States to launch big new wars as well as expand the numerous ones\
      \ we\u2019re already waging across wide swaths of the Middle East, Africa, and\
      \ South Asia.\u201D\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that Bustani \u2014 who did so\
      \ much to prevent the threat of conflict and the proliferation of chemical weapons\
      \ before being ousted by Bolton \u2014 believes the latter\u2019s appointment\
      \ as Trump\u2019s national security adviser could spell \u201Cdisaster\u201D\
      \ for the world?"

      \nAfter months of delay and Republican attempts to defy court orders, Wisconsin\

      \ elections June 12. The Republican leaders of the state legislature also dropped\
      \ plans to convene a special session to change Wisconsin law and cancel the\

      \ the state Assembly\u2014joined his administration in December, claiming it\
      \ would be a waste of money since the legislature was set to adjourn in the\
      \ spring. A Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder sued\

      \ Dane County judge,\u201D even though she was appointed by Walker in 2014,\
      \ and announced they would re-convene to pass legislation to nullify the elections.\n\
      \nWalker went back to court to ask for more time to postpone holding the elections,\

      \ University Law School. He blogs at Sidebarsblog.com. Follow @rdeliason.\n\n\
      President Trump\u2019s now-former attorney John Dowd allegedly told lawyers\
      \ representing Paul J. Manafort and Michael Flynn last year that the president\
      \ would consider pardoning the two men if they got into legal trouble. (Dowd\
      \ has denied the reports.) Much of the news coverage has focused on whether\
      \ offering pardons to induce a witness not to cooperate in the special counsel\u2019\
      s investigation could constitute obstruction of justice. But there is another\
      \ potential charge that could apply more directly and that prosecutors might\
      \ have reason to favor: conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nFederal bribery requires\
      \ that a public official agree to receive and accept something of value in exchange\
      \ for being influenced in the performance of an official act. In this scenario,\
      \ the official act would be granting a pardon. While the Supreme Court\u2019\
      s 2016 decision in the case of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell\
      \ dramatically narrowed the definition of \u201Cofficial act,\u201D there\u2019\
      s no question that a president granting a pardon would be an exercise of government\
      \ power under the McDonnell v. United States standard.\n\n\u201CThing of value\u201D\
      \ is also fairly easily met: It would be the agreement not to cooperate against\
      \ the president. The thing of value in bribery law is not limited to envelopes\
      \ stuffed with cash. It can include anything of subjective value to the public\
      \ official, whether tangible or intangible. Such intangibles as offers of future\
      \ employment and personal companionship have been found to be things of value\
      \ for purposes of bribery. A promise not to cooperate in special counsel Robert\
      \ S. Mueller III\u2019s probe could readily serve as the quid in this quid pro\
      \ quo.\n\nThe public official, of course, is the president. Dowd is not a public\
      \ official and cannot be bribed himself, but he could conspire with a public\
      \ official to arrange bribes on the official\u2019s behalf. The theory would\
      \ be that Dowd and the president engaged in a conspiracy to accept bribes by\
      \ agreeing that Dowd would make the offer. This, of course, would require proof\
      \ that Dowd was acting with the president\u2019s approval and not merely freelancing.\n\
      \nNeither bribery nor conspiracy requires that the underlying scheme be successful.\
      \ The crime is the agreement itself, coupled with at least some steps to carry\
      \ it out. If Dowd and the president agreed Dowd would offer an exchange of pardons\
      \ for silence and he did so, that is a conspiracy to commit bribery. Whether\
      \ the offer was accepted would not matter.\n\nThanks to the unusual circumstances\
      \ in this case, bribery has a significant legal advantage over obstruction of\
      \ justice. There has been considerable academic debate regarding whether a president\
      \ can be charged with obstruction for a constitutionally authorized act, such\
      \ as firing the FBI director or granting a pardon. Some argue that such an act,\
      \ standing alone, can never be charged as obstruction regardless of the president\u2019\
      s intent because that would unconstitutionally impinge on the president\u2019\
      s executive authority. (I disagree with this view.)\n\nBut even those who make\
      \ that argument agree that if the president engaged in independently criminal\
      \ conduct, such as accepting a bribe or instructing witnesses to lie, he would\
      \ not be shielded from criminal prosecution \u2014 even if those actions were\
      \ related to a constitutionally authorized act such as granting a pardon.\n\n\
      In other words, even scholars who think that merely granting a pardon could\
      \ never amount to obstruction agree that a president who took a bribe in exchange\
      \ for granting a pardon could be charged with bribery. Of course no pardons\
      \ have actually been granted \u2014 at least not yet. But regardless, the bribery\
      \ theory avoids all of the legal uncertainty swirling around obstruction-of-justice\
      \ charges and pardons. Nobody argues that bribery is constitutionally authorized.\n\
      \nI\u2019m certainly not saying that we know any of this happened. Nor am I\
      \ discounting the evidentiary hurdles prosecutors would face in proving a conspiracy\
      \ and that a corrupt deal was offered; bribery is notoriously difficult to prove.\
      \ But as a legal theory, I think it\u2019s sound. If Mueller is examining these\
      \ alleged events, I\u2019d be surprised if a possible conspiracy to commit bribery\
      \ were not in the mix."

      \nThis article first appeared on Common Dreams.\n\nThe #GOPTaxScam is living\
      \ up to the moniker it earned from critics last year, according to a new poll\
      \ that shows the majority of Americans are not seeing paycheck increases from\
      \ the plan that Republicans forced through Congress in December.\n\nA new CNBC\
      \ poll found that less than a third of those surveyed earlier this month reported\
      \ taking home more money because of the new tax code, compared with 16 percent\
      \ who said they were unsure and 52 percent who said their take-home pay did\
      \ not go up.\n\nThere were clear income level and partisan divides in the results.\
      \ Of those who reported an increase, more than 42 percent earn over $75,000\
      \ per year, and 52 percent of Republicans claimed they saw an increase, compared\
      \ with only 20 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of Independents.\n\nWhile\
      \ CNBC reporter Steve Liesman claimed the results were \"quite astonishing,\"\
      \ they did not shock many economics experts who warned last year that the plan\
      \ was designed to primarily benefit deep-pocketed campaign donors at the expense\
      \ of working families.\n\n\"Am I surprised? Of course not!\" declared Helaine\
      \ Olen, a finance blogger for the Washington Post. \"This was entirely predictable\u2014\
      despite Republican claims to the contrary last year.\"\n\nMichael Linden, policy\
      \ and research director for the Hub Project and a Roosevelt Institute fellow,\
      \ outlined in a tweet why the results were \"not surprising at all.\"\n\nPointing\
      \ to analysis from the Tax Policy Center, which predicted that the average middle-income\
      \ household would take in an extra $930\u2014or less than $18 per week\u2014\
      because of the GOP tax plan, Olen wrote, \"That's enough for an extra lunch\
      \ at Chipotle (average check: $12) but won't even cover a steak dinner at Outback\
      \ Steakhouse.\"\n\nCNBC's findings align with a Politico/Morning Consult poll\
      \ released last month, which found that only 25 percent of registered voters\
      \ polled saw an increase in their income, while 51 percent had not. And, like\
      \ the CNBC respondents, Morning Consult's co-founder and chief research officer\
      \ Kyle Dropp said, \"Our polling shows high-income earners are more likely to\
      \ have noticed an increase in their paychecks as a result of the tax bill.\"\
      \n\nWhile low- and middle-income workers aren't seeing the \"laughably untrue\"\
      \ benefits promised to them by GOP lawmakers who fought for the tax scam, the\
      \ plan\u2014which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to just 21 percent\u2014\
      has been a boon to businesses, particularly those in the fossil fuel industry,\
      \ according to recent analysis.\n\n\"Perhaps Republicans can take comfort from\
      \ the long view: The individual tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025,\
      \ even as the corporate cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, continue,\"\
      \ quipped Olen. \"Maybe ordinary voters won't notice that their tax cut disappeared\
      \ even as those enjoyed by the rich live on in perpetuity. \""

      \ she felt a pang of dread. According to the report, which soon scrawled across\
      \ cable news chyrons, President Donald Trump had maintained close communication\
      \ with Porter and hoped to see him return to the White House, despite the multiple\
      \ allegations of domestic abuse that led to his departure last month.\n\n\"\
      I'm not surprised,\" Willoughby told Newsweek on Thursday. \"No one can blackmail\
      \ Rob now, because people know he's abusive. It seems like, from the White House's\
      \ point of view, maybe he deserves to have a job again if he's not a security\
      \ threat.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has denied\
      \ any plans to bring Porter back, stating that Trump has only spoken with Porter\
      \ once since he left his post. But Willoughby says that the president and his\
      \ administration have made their position on domestic abuse clear nonetheless.\n\
      \n\"The White House is setting an example for how companies will address domestic\
      \ abuse, how families will address domestic abuse, how our country and even\
      \ other countries will address it,\" Willoughby said Thursday. \"It's showing\
      \ that someone who is known to be abusive will still be revered and valued in\
      \ his job. We're showing that the United States doesn't address domestic abuse.\"\
      \n\nWilloughby publicly said she endured physical, verbal and emotional abuse\
      \ in February, when reporters found a blog post she authored titled \"Why I\
      \ Stayed.\" The post, which she wrote in April 2017, detailed an abusive relationship\
      \ with a partner the Daily Mail revealed to be Porter, to whom she was married\
      \ from 2009 to 2013. \"The first time he called me a 'fucking bitch' was on\

      \ kicked his first wife on theirs.)\"\n\nWilloughby knew it was only a matter\
      \ of time before the press reached out to Colbie Holderness, the first wife\
      \ she mentions, whom Willoughby had met just once for lunch the year before,\
      \ following their respective FBI interviews about Porter's personal history.\
      \ She was right: Over the coming weeks, a photo of Holderness with a black eye\
      \ she allegedly received from Porter during their marriage dominated the news\
      \ cycle.\n\nWhite House officials struggled to answer questions about how much\
      \ they knew about Porter's past, and why they'd let him keep his job when allegations\
      \ from Holderness and Willoughby had been stalling his security clearance. Trump,\
      \ meanwhile, praised Porter for his service.\n\nKeep up with this story and\
      \ more by subscribing now\n\nJennie Willoughby\n\nWilloughby said when she was\
      \ first called on by the media to relay her account and respond to her news\
      \ of her ex-husband's departure from the West Wing, she felt like a \"deer in\
      \ the headlights.\" She said she'd only answered the questions that were asked\
      \ of her with the hope that soon she'd be out of the public eye and would no\
      \ longer have to see Porter's name everywhere she turned.\n\nWhen she saw New\
      \ York Times reporter Maggie Haberman's story on Monday, Willoughby said she\
      \ reached out to Holderness, and the two of them worried, \"What if this is\
      \ starting all over again?\"\n\nBut now, Willoughby says she feels stronger,\
      \ and ready to tell her story on her own terms. She spends much of her time\
      \ answering emails from domestic abuse survivors like herself, and has plans\
      \ to continue the conversation with domestic abuse survivor advocacy groups\
      \ and battered women's shelters.\n\n\"I'm taking control of the narrative now,\"\
      \ Willoughby said. \"I have to keep speaking for domestic abuse victims who\
      \ don't have a voice.\""

      \ much of this work in his role as a manager at Cambridge Analytica; Nix, in\
      \ turn, was directed by Stephen Bannon, a co-founder of Cambridge Analytica.\
      \ In particular, Nix and other SCL Elections Ltd. employees reportedly participated\
      \ in strategic decision-making processes of John Bolton Super PAC, a U.S. political\
      \ committee, starting as early as 2014, and according to Nix played a similar\

      \ In 2016, Bannon left Cambridge Analytica for the Trump campaign, which then\

      \ and David Hogg speak at a panel discussion titled, \u201C#NEVERAGAIN: How\
      \ Parkland Students Are Changing the Conversation on Guns\u201D at Harvard University\
      \ on March 20 in Boston. Paul Marotta/Getty Images\n\nThe longer the Parkland\
      \ students continue their protests around gun control, the more they are being\
      \ targeted by worsening insults, lies, and unhinged accusations. Two of the\
      \ school\u2019s highest-profile activists, David Hogg and Emma Gonz\xE1lez,\
      \ have become the focus of a particularly troll-like strain of pro-gun anger\
      \ and this week were likened to Nazis, Communists, and anti-American traitors.\n\
      \nThe attacks now come not just from the alt-right and anonymous Twitter louts.\
      \ Since the weekend\u2019s massive marches for gun control, more and more prominent\
      \ figures in media and politics are aiming previously unfathomable public attacks\
      \ at the youngsters.\n\nThe derision came early, in the form of the conspiracy\
      \ theories from the usual sources. Radicals on Twitter were accusing the students\
      \ of being actors even as news reports of the Feb. 14 shooting were still coming\
      \ in, and conspiracy-theory king Alex Jones quickly spread these falsehoods\
      \ further\u2014despite eventual pushback from internet platforms.\n\nFast-forward\
      \ a month, and we began to see fabricated attacks like this viral GIF altered\
      \ to show Emma Gonz\xE1lez appearing to tear up the U.S. Constitution, which\
      \ caught on during the March for Our Lives. At its peak, it was shared by actor\
      \ Adam Baldwin, who in the caption of the now-deleted tweet compared her to\
      \ a member of the Hitler Youth. (In the real video, published by Teen Vogue,\
      \ Gonz\xE1lez tore up a gun-range target.)\n\nHogg, meanwhile, has been repeatedly\
      \ smeared in memes likening him to Adolf Hitler.\n\nAll in favor of Gun Control\

      \ (@edbenson98) March 28, 2018\n\nIn notable instances of prominent people making\
      \ bizarre critiques of the Parkland students, Iowa Rep. Steve King\u2019s campaign\
      \ Facebook page mocked Gonz\xE1lez for wearing a Cuba flag patch on her jacket.\
      \ \u201CThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak\
      \ Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship\
      \ turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens,\u201D\
      \ the Facebook post read. \u201C[H]ence their right to self defense.\u201D\n\
      \nThe campaign team then defended itself by saying the \u201Cmeme in question\u201D\
      \ was \u201Cobviously\u201D not an attack on Gonz\xE1lez\u2019s heritage but\
      \ \u201Cmerely points out the irony of someone pushing gun control while wearing\
      \ the flag of a country that was oppressed by a communist, anti-gun regime.\u201D\
      \ (It also seemed to say that Gonz\xE1lez should speak Spanish, despite the\
      \ fact that King has said before that \u201CAssimilation, not diversity, is\
      \ our American strength.\u201D Also, the Cuban flag predates Castro\u2019s regime.)\n\
      \nKing might be the most prominent politician to attack the Parkland students\
      \ individually, but he isn\u2019t the only one. As a testimony to the pervasive\
      \ influence of conspiracy-mongering pro-gun conservatives online, local political\
      \ figures have given in to liking, sharing, and echoing arguments untethered\
      \ to facts but strong in conviction, intended only to undermine the efforts\
      \ of these teenage victims. Or, feeding off partisan anger, they have simply\
      \ resorted to insults. Here are more examples of such attacks from political\
      \ figures:\n\nBenjamin Kelly, Aide to Florida State Rep. Shawn Harrison\n\n\
      On Feb. 20, Ben Kelly emailed a Tampa Bay Times reporter, unsolicited, with\
      \ a then-shocking statement about Hogg and Gonz\xE1lez. \u201CBoth kids in the\
      \ picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when\
      \ they happen,\u201D he said in the email.\n\nWhen the Times asked for evidence\
      \ supporting his claim, Kelly sent an email, still from his official government\
      \ account, linking to a conspiracy video showing Hogg in a news clip in California\
      \ as evidence he was a crisis actor. \u201CThere is a clip on you tube that\
      \ shows Mr. Hogg out in California,\u201D Kelly wrote. \u201C(I guess he transferred?)\u201D\
      \n\nHarrison told a reporter that Kelly should not have sent the email. He then\
      \ said he placed Kelly on leave and that Kelly shared the statement \u201Cwithout\
      \ my knowledge.\u201D Kelly was then fired by state House Speaker Richard Corcoran.\n\
      \nThe day before, on his personal Twitter account, according to the Times, Kelly\
      \ liked a tweet calling Gonz\xE1lez a \u201Cbrown bald lesbian girl.\u201D\n\
      \nLeslie Gibson, Republican Candidate for the Maine State House\n\nJust over\
      \ two weeks ago, when Gibson was running unopposed for the seat, he said in\
      \ a since-deleted tweet that \u201CThere is nothing about this skinhead lesbian\
      \ that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you\u2019\
      re a frothing at the mouth moonbat.\u201D The tweet was referring to Gonz\xE1\
      lez, who is openly bisexual and who has a buzz cut. He also called Hogg a \u201C\
      moron\u201D and a \u201Cbaldfaced liar.\u201D\n\nIn the outrage that ensued,\
      \ some state legislators condemned his comments, and Hogg took to Twitter to\
      \ ask people to run against Gibson. Two challengers surfaced just days later,\
      \ and Gibson withdrew from the race. \u201CI am walking away with my head held\
      \ high,\u201D he said.\n\nAnthony Testaverde, Longtime Aide to New York State\
      \ Sen. Martin Golden\n\nOn Saturday, Testaverde shared on Facebook a photo of\
      \ Hogg holding his right fist in the air at the March for Our Lives demonstration.\
      \ Next to it was a historical photo of Hitler saluting. Below, an image of Hogg\
      \ wearing a black mourning band was compared to a photo of a Nazi swastika armband.\
      \ \u201CI knew something was off about this kid,\u201D the post declares.\n\n\
      The comparison of the Parkland activists and other gun control advocates to\
      \ Nazis cites a historically flawed argument that has long persisted in pro-gun\
      \ circles about the Third Reich taking away German citizens\u2019 guns, preventing\
      \ effective resistance. \u201CThe Democrats are doing exactly what Hitler did,\u201D\
      \ Testaverde wrote in another post. \u201CHe used the youth to disarm and control\
      \ the people. This is scary!\u201D\n\nSen. Golden faced loud criticism for the\
      \ actions of his aide, and he publicly condemned Testaverde\u2019s posts as\
      \ \u201Coffensive\u201D and \u201Cmisguided\u201D but refused to say he would\
      \ fire him. On Tuesday, Testaverde was fired.\n\nMary Franson, Minnesota State\
      \ Representative\n\nOn Saturday night, Franson shared a Facebook post that referred\
      \ to Hogg as \u201CSupreme Leader.\u201D She then shared a quote, via the conservative\
      \ site the Daily Wire, from the March for Our Lives speech by Delaney Tarr,\
      \ a 17-year-old Parkland survivor, who said, \u201CWhen they give us that inch,\
      \ that bump stock ban, we will take a mile!\u201D Franson\u2019s commentary\
      \ above that quote was \u201CAnd there you have it friends \u2026 the anti gunners,\
      \ the high school students who speak for all, aren\u2019t interested in an \u2018\
      inch\u2019. They want the mile. They want your guns. Gone.\u201D\n\nThe kicker,\
      \ though, came about 15 minutes later when she posted a link from the U.S. Holocaust\
      \ Memorial Museum website titled, \u201CShaping the Future: Indoctrinating Youth.\u201D\
      \ Above, she quoted Hitler talking about indoctrination. Later, as she faced\
      \ criticism over linking Parkland survivors to Nazi youths, she argued that\
      \ the indoctrination post was unrelated to her earlier posts and denounced the\
      \ media for making the connection.\n\nIf more proof was needed that insults\
      \ and conspiracy theories have mainstream power, Donald Trump Jr. liked two\
      \ tweets attacking Hogg. In one, conservative TV host Graham Ledger linked an\
      \ article from Gateway Pundit and suggested Hogg, whose father is a former FBI\
      \ agent, was \u201Crunning cover\u201D for his father because the FBI \u201C\
      botched\u201D tracking down the shooter. Trump Jr. liked another tweet peddling\
      \ the same conspiracy with a post from a far-right website about the \u201C\
      Outspoken Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor\u201D that doubted Hogg was\
      \ an actual victim and blamed the \u201CDeep State media\u201D for giving him\
      \ a platform.\n\nGiven that the Parkland student-activists are still working\
      \ to encourage more town hall events and more demonstrations, it seems likely\
      \ these teenagers will face evermore vile personal and public attacks in the\
      \ months to come. Although we cannot expect any personal responsibility from\
      \ internet trolls, Americans should expect better from public officials, who\
      \ have the power to lend legitimacy to the more disgraceful arguments circling\
      \ around social media. But in the instances above, the public responded by rejecting\
      \ the hateful arguments, and proved we have the power to hold these politicians\
      \ to account."

      \ warn his political supporters against complacency in the fall midterm elections.\n\
      \nAs Trump told it, the country was headed in the wrong direction - until he\
      \ took office. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been an economy like this,\u2019\

      Trump promised to repair the nation\u2019s ailing roads, bridges and other infrastructure\
      \ \u2018\u2018from a source of endless frustration into a source of absolutely\
      \ incredible pride.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018And we\u2019re going to do it\
      \ all under budget and ahead of schedule,\u2019\u2019 the president promised,\
      \ seeming to look past the reality that his $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan\
      \ has little apparent momentum on Capitol Hill. The plan has received only tepid\
      \ support from Congress since the administration unveiled it earlier this year.\n\
      \nChief among the infrastructure projects Trump promoted here was his long-promised\
      \ wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re getting that sucker\
      \ built!\u2019\u2019 Trump said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s what I do. I build.\
      \ I was always very good at building. It was my best thing. I think better than\
      \ being president, I was always very good at building.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019\
      s visit to Ohio is his first public appearance this week - a notable absence\
      \ from the spotlight for a president who relishes the give-and-take with reporters\
      \ and typically has daily opportunities for the media to see him doing his job.\n\
      \nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has not been seen in public since porn actress Stormy\
      \ Daniels appeared last Sunday night on \u2018\u201860 Minutes,\u2019\u2019\
      \ detailing her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nAn\
      \ estimated 22 million Americans watched the CBS broadcast - including the president,\
      \ aides said, who fumed about it privately but withheld any public comments\
      \ or counterattacks. White House spokespeople said Trump categorically denied\
      \ all the allegations made by Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\
      \nIn his Ohio speech, Trump remained silent on the Daniels saga and instead\
      \ talked about a medley of issues that animate the working-class voters who\
      \ voted for him. He talked about defeating Islamic State terrorists, renegotiating\
      \ trade deals, investing in the military, nominating conservative judges and\
      \ cracking down on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump speech was reminiscent of his\
      \ campaign rallies. Indeed, he twice mentioned his 2016 foe, Democrat Hillary\
      \ Clinton. Bemoaning the U.S. trade agreement with South Korea, which his administration\
      \ renegotiated this week, Trump called the KORUS deal \u2018\u2018a Hillary\
      \ Clinton special\u2019\u2019 - perhaps because she was secretary of state when\
      \ former president Barack Obama negotiated the last iteration of the agreement\
      \ in 2010. But the treaty was first executed in 2007, during the George W. Bush\
      \ administration.\n\nAs is typical for Trump, the president appeared at several\
      \ times to veer off his prepared remarks on infrastructure policy to interject\
      \ with comments perhaps designed to appeal to his audience.\n\n\u2018\u2018\
      I don\u2019t know what that means, a community college,\u2019\u2019 Trump said\
      \ at one point. \u2018\u2018Call it vocational and technical. People know what\
      \ that means. They don\u2019t know what a community college means.\u2019\u2019\
      \n\nAs he left the Oval Office on Thursday morning to begin his trip to Ohio,\
      \ Trump bade farewell to Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest\
      \ confidantes. Hicks is leaving her post as White House communications director.\n\
      \nTrump is set to join his family Thursday evening in Palm Beach, Florida, where\
      \ he will spend the Easter holiday weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago estate.\
      \ First lady Melania Trump and the couple\u2019s 12-year-old son, Barron, have\
      \ been at Mar-a-Lago for the full week on what aides called a traditional spring\
      \ break.\n\nTrump\u2019s two daughters joined him on the trip to Ohio and onto\

      \nAbout 30 seconds into his address, he choked up and then regained his composure.\
      \ He spoke of the honor of leading the best \u201Cscience-based, data-driven\
      \ agency in the world. I've dreamed of doing this for a long time.\u201D\n\n\
      The 45-minute session at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which employees were\
      \ able to watch or listen to from locations across the United States and around\
      \ the world, was well received by employees. Redfield came across as knowledgeable\
      \ and well briefed.\n\n\u201CI'm a little nervous. I'm an outsider,\u201D he\
      \ said. \u201CI didn't grow up here in CDC, but I hope you accept me as a member\
      \ of the family and accept my wife, because we're here to serve side by side\
      \ with you.\u201D\n\nSeveral staff members noted his strong embrace of science\
      \ and said they were especially gratified to hear him say that if the CDC has\
      \ evidence to support a public health intervention, the intervention should\
      \ be applied.\n\nThe Maryland clinician has moved quickly to take the helm of\
      \ the CDC. He was sworn in Monday in Washington by Health and Human Services\
      \ Secretary Alex Azar, flew to Atlanta and met Wednesday with the directors\
      \ of the CDC's individual centers.\n\nRedfield\u2019s main career focus has\
      \ been chronic human infections, especially HIV/AIDS. He headed clinical care\
      \ and research at the University of Maryland medical school\u2019s Institute\
      \ of Human Virology. He also oversaw programs caring for 6,000 patients in the\
      \ Baltimore-Washington region, as well as for more than 1.3 million patients\
      \ in Africa and the Caribbean as part of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan\
      \ for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR.\n\nHis appointment had drawn criticism because\
      \ of his once-controversial positions on HIV testing during the first decade\
      \ of the AIDS crisis, his ties to conservative AIDS organizations that supported\
      \ abstinence-based prevention and his lack of experience with governmental public\
      \ health organizations.\n\nHe takes the agency's helm at a time when scientists\
      \ and public health experts are concerned about the commitment of the CDC and\
      \ HHS to science- and evidence-based research. Just three months ago, CDC employees\
      \ were advised to avoid seven words or phrases in narratives in preparing the\
      \ fiscal 2019 budget. Some \u201Cwords to avoid\u201D were spelled out in an\
      \ HHS style guide, and instruction about others, including \u201Cevidence-based\u201D\
      \ and \u201Cscience-based,\u201D were given verbally by a CDC official. Department\
      \ officials have provided different accounts of how that verbal guidance took\
      \ place but said it was not official administration policy.\n\nThe agency is\
      \ \u201Cscience-based and data-driven, and that's why CDC has the credibility\
      \ around the world that it has,\u201D Redfield said Thursday, before choking\
      \ up again as he talked about the chance to work there after a 20-year academic\
      \ career. \u201CAcademia does not solve problems. Academia is not a service\
      \ organization.\u201D\n\nRedfield didn't address some of the criticism over\
      \ policies he supported decades ago, such as mandatory HIV screening, that some\
      \ AIDS advocates said were not sound public health approaches. But in talking\
      \ Thursday about ways to end the AIDS epidemic in the United States \u2014 which\
      \ he said could be accomplished within three to seven years \u2014 he voiced\
      \ support for comprehensive prevention strategies.\n\n\u201CI've never been\
      \ an abstinence-only person,\u201D he said. \u201CJust ask my wife,\u201D he\
      \ added, prompting laughter from the audience. \u201CI believe in every measure\
      \ we have scientific evidence for, including condoms.\u201D\n\nHe also spoke\
      \ of the importance of vaccines and recounted how as an Army doctor in the early\
      \ 1980s, he helped persuade military leadership to vaccinate \u201Cevery individual\
      \ in the armed forces\u201D against hepatitis B after a young soldier for whom\
      \ Redfield had cared infected his wife and newborn child. \u201CThat's probably\
      \ the most important thing I did in my life,\u201D he said.\n\nToo many people\
      \ don't understand the importance of vaccination, he continued, mentioning the\
      \ 130 children who have died this flu season. \u201CWe have got to get the American\
      \ public to understand that vaccination is important and needs to be fully utilized.\u201D\
      \n\nRedfield said the opioid epidemic is \u201Cthe public health crisis of our\
      \ time\u201D and agreed with Azar that it is a medical, not a moral, problem\
      \ on which the CDC will help lead the government's response. He also likened\
      \ the stigma around addiction to that during the early days of AIDS. Redfield,\
      \ who has five children and nine grandchildren, has close personal experience\
      \ with the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201CIf any of you have tried to access care for\
      \ addiction in this nation, I can guarantee you it's complicated,\u201D he said.\
      \ \u201CIt needs to not be complicated.\u201D\n\nAlthough his supporters point\
      \ to his strong background in infectious disease and global health, public health\
      \ experts inside and outside the agency say one of his biggest challenges will\
      \ be his limited governmental public health experience, especially involving\
      \ emergency responses.\n\nRedfield spoke about organizing a relief effort during\
      \ the 2010 Haiti earthquake and about his experiences working in Africa on the\
      \ PEPFAR program. But he acknowledged that the CDC's most important mission\
      \ is to protect Americans from emerging health threats, whether they are naturally\
      \ occurring diseases or bioterrorism.\n\n\u201CI pray it doesn't happen on our\
      \ watch. But I want to make sure we're all prepared, whether it's flu \u2014\
      \ my biggest fear \u2014 or MERS or something else,\u201D he said, referring\
      \ to Middle East respiratory syndrome, an acute viral respiratory illness. \u201C\
      I respect the mission we have, which is to be prepared for what we don't expect.\u201D\
      \n\nRedfield said he has gotten a list of 57 items from his wife about what\
      \ he should do. \u201CNumber one, listen. Number two, don't interrupt. Number\
      \ three, listen.\u201D\n\nThe job heading the country\u2019s foremost public\
      \ health agency had been vacant since Jan. 31, when former Georgia public health\
      \ commissioner Brenda Fitzgerald resigned after serving only half a year. She\
      \ was unable to divest from \u201Ccomplex financial interests\u201D in a \u201C\
      definitive time period,\u201D according to an HHS statement. Fitzgerald had\
      \ also purchased shares in a tobacco company shortly after becoming CDC director.\
      \ Azar accepted her resignation two days after he was sworn in.\n\nRead more:\n\

      \ rebuilding the country's crumbling infrastructure, an initiative that would\
      \ create jobs, stimulate the economy, and improve the safety of American public\

      ll become much less fake. May take a while, but it\u2019s happening.\u201D\n\
      \nWhat a time to be alive. Trump finished up with something about \"working\

      \ a ballot illegally \u2014 for five years.\n\nMason was indicted on a charge\
      \ of illegal voting in Tarrant County, Tex., last year and found guilty by State\
      \ District Judge Ruben Gonzalez on Thursday, despite her protestations that\
      \ she simply was not aware that she was barred from casting a ballot and never\

      \ hardest thing in my life to deal with. Who would \u2014 as a mother, as a\
      \ provider \u2014 leave their kids over voting?\u201D\n\nThe case is yet another\
      \ illustration of Texas\u2019s zealous crackdown on voter fraud, a problem that\
      \ state GOP leaders have described as \u201Crampant\u201D in the past but for\
      \ which they have yet to provide hard proof, save for isolated cases such as\
      \ Mason\u2019s.\n\nIn a 2016 ruling rejecting Texas\u2019s stringent voter ID\
      \ law, which state lawmakers had pitched as a way to stop voter fraud, the U.S.\
      \ Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found only two convictions for in-person\
      \ voter fraud out of 20 million ballots cast in the years before the 2011 passage\
      \ of the law.\n\nWhile in-person voter fraud is considered extremely rare, mail-in\
      \ voter fraud is less so. In 2016, Dallas County had to sequester roughly 700\
      \ suspicious mail-in ballots for a city council race after receiving complaints\
      \ from voters, who received mail-in ballots they didn\u2019t request.\n\nStill,\
      \ after the 2016 general election, President Trump assembled a now-defunct \u201C\
      voter fraud commission\u201D amid his baseless claims that millions of people\
      \ voted illegally. Texas\u2019s pursuit of in-person voter fraud reflected the\
      \ Trump administration\u2019s zeal.\n\nIn February 2017, another woman in Tarrant\
      \ County, a Mexican national with a green card, was sentenced to eight years\
      \ in prison after falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen on her ballot. According\
      \ to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Rosa Maria Ortega, a mother of four, testified\
      \ that she had confused the difference between rights granted to legal permanent\
      \ resident and to a U.S. citizen, which a jury did not buy. She had voted as\
      \ a Republican in elections in 2012 and 2014.\n\n\u201CThis case shows how serious\
      \ Texas is about keeping its elections secure, and the outcome sends a message\
      \ that violators of the state\u2019s election law will be prosecuted to the\
      \ fullest,\u201D Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said after Ortega was sentenced.\
      \ \u201D\n\nSt. John said he believes that Mason\u2019s five-year prison sentence,\
      \ for what he said was an honest mistake, is a direct result of such rhetoric\
      \ from Paxton\u2019s office.\n\n\u201CShe voted in good faith. She showed who\
      \ she was. Everything was truthful,\u201D St. John said. \u201CJust like she\
      \ said in court, \u2018Why would I want to jeopardize all the work I did to\
      \ get out of prison, go to the halfway house and get back to my family, if I\
      \ knew voting was going to get me into prison?\u201D\n\nOn the day of the presidential\
      \ election, Nov 8., 2016, Mason arrived at her polling place to find that her\
      \ name wasn\u2019t on the voter roll, St. John said.\n\nAn election worker offered\
      \ to help, he said, and presented her with a provisional ballot, which allows\
      \ a person to cast a vote as long as they certify they are eligible by signing\
      \ an affidavit. Small print at the top asks the voter to certify that if she\
      \ is a felon, she has fully completed her sentence, including supervision or\
      \ parole of any kind. Mason tried to explain to the judge that, since an election\
      \ worker was helping her, she was not reading carefully, which, St. John said,\
      \ failed to sway him.\n\nUltimately, her vote didn\u2019t even count. Provisional\
      \ ballots are subject to review, which ultimately led to an investigation of\
      \ Mason.\n\nSt. John said he has already filed an appeal, hoping to keep his\
      \ client out of prison so she can remain with her family. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram\
      \ reported that a \u201Cchorus of small children\u201D waved goodbye to her\

      Michael Cohen at risk of ethical sanctions.


      Schwartz represents Cohen, who has admitted paying Daniels $130,000 just days
      before the 2016 presidential election to sign an agreement that barred her from
      publicly discussing what she has said was a tryst with Trump a decade earlier.


      Representatives for Trump have said he denies any such affair with the porn
      actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.'

    text: 'A Montgomery judge has denied a motion filed by Roy Moore''s attorneys
      to dismiss the defamation lawsuit filed by Leigh Corfman, one of the former
      U.S. Senate candidate''s accusers.


      Montgomery County Circuit Judge Roman Ashley Shaul has also scheduled the lawsuit''s
      first court hearing for April 12.


      In the order issued Wednesday afternoon, the judge also denied Moore''s request
      to transfer the case to his home of Etowah County as well as denied Moore''s
      request for a hearing to make oral arguments on the issue of dismissing the
      lawsuit and relocating to Etowah County.


      Corfman filed her lawsuit in January, less than a month after Moore lost the
      U.S. Senate special election to Doug Jones. Corfman came forward in a Washington
      Post story on Nov. 9, 2017, alleging that Moore made unwanted sexual advances
      toward her when she was 14 years old and he was 32.


      Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations by Corfman and other women who made
      allegations of unwanted romantic or sexual advances. He has re-stated those
      denials in court documents.


      "We''re gratified by the court''s ruling and that Leigh will now have an opportunity
      to prove her case in court," Neil Roman, one of Corfman''s attorneys, said in
      a statement to AL.com.


      Moore''s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment from
      AL.com.


      In addition to opposing Moore''s desire to dismiss the lawsuit, Corfman''s attorneys
      also resisted Moore''s request to move the case to Etowah County.


      The hearing on April 12 will be for the judge to "hear arguments on possible
      discovery limitations," Shaul said in his order.


      Moore''s attorneys had requested that discovery be delayed until the judge ruled
      on the issue of venue and the motion to dismiss.


      Corfman''s based her lawsuit on comments made about her by Moore and those connected
      with his campaign.


      According to the lawsuit, Moore and his campaign committee "have defamed Ms.
      Corfman, repeatedly and in all forms of media, calling her a liar and questioning
      her motivation for publicly disclosing that Mr. Moore sexually abused her in
      1979 when she was a 14-year-old high school freshman and he was a 32-year-old
      assistant district attorney."


      Moore had asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit because it was not filed in
      the proper venue -- arguing that it rightfully should have been filed in Etowah
      County, where Corfman said the encounter with Moore occurred. Moore''s attorneys
      also said that the case should be moved to Etowah County for the convenience
      of the parties involved, saying that both the plaintiff and defendant reside
      in Etowah County.


      The response from Corfman''s attorneys were that Moore wanted the case moved
      to Etowah County because it would be a "home forum." And that of the nine people
      named or involved in the lawsuit, all but three live closer to Montgomery than
      the Etowah County seat of Gadsden. Those three, Corfman said, are Corfman, Moore
      and Corfman''s mother, who did not mind traveling to Montgomery.


      And Corfman argued that Moore''s attorneys, in a December lawsuit filed in a
      failed attempt to have the election results certified, was filed in Montgomery
      County. In that lawsuit, Moore''s attorneys described Corfman as making "false
      and malicious attacks."


      In seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed, Moore''s attorneys argued that comments
      made by a political candidate on the campaign stump should be protected speech
      and a candidate should be allowed to defend himself against allegations such
      as those raised by Corfman.

    text: "On Wednesday actress Roseanne Barr received a phone call from President\
      \ Donald Trump congratulating her on the ratings for the reboot of her sitcom,\
      \ Roseanne.\n\nBut as recently as November, Barr fans were speculating that\
      \ the Trump-supporting actress had secretly been taken out and swapped with\
      \ an imposter as part of a massive \u201Cdeep state\u201D conspiracy.\n\nBarr\u2019\

      \ returning Tuesday to a massive viewership of more than 18 million. Since the\
      \ show\u2019s last episode in 1997, Barr\u2019s politics have taken a sharp\
      \ turn right, with the actress voicing her support for Trump as well as a number\
      \ of fringe conspiracy theories. In November, she became a bit player in one\
      \ of her favorite theories: a 4Chan-based conspiracy called QAnon that alleges\
      \ satanism and sex-trafficking by Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\n\u201Cwho is Q?\u201D\
      \ Barr tweeted the morning of Nov. 17.\n\n\u201Ctell Qanon to DM me in the nexxt\

      \ being involved in a satanic child-sex-trafficking ring. Or something. QAnon\u2019\
      s messages have always been vague to the point of near-gibberish, opening them\
      \ to interpretation. When QAnon has given specifics\u2014like the time he claimed\
      \ John Podesta would be arrested or indicted Nov. 3\u2014the prediction has\
      \ fallen flat.\n\nDays after that failed prophecy, Barr was on Twitter asking\
      \ her followers to put her in touch with QAnon. Then, in what believers interpreted\
      \ as confirmation of the QAnon theory, Barr\u2019s internet presence went dark.\
      \ Her Twitter account appeared to be suspended for several hours, and her website\
      \ went offline for \u201Ctechnical reasons\u201D according to a notice on the\
      \ homepage.\n\n\u201CRoseanne had been talking about Q mostly all day and asking\

      \ to make it seem like Twitter is cooked,\u201D one wrote.\n\nThe month after\
      \ her brief disappearance, Barr deleted all her tweets and announced a temporary\
      \ Twitter retirement after a knock-down fight with Hillary Clinton supporters\
      \ on the website.\n\nShe was back in January, and has since resumed tweeting\
      \ about QAnon, in apparent contradiction of fans who had previously claimed\
      \ Twitter was censoring her conspiracy tweets. Since Friday, she has tweeted\
      \ or retweeted content relating to QAnon (or its other name \u201CThe Storm\u201D\
      ) at least four times, in addition to a March 24 tweet that read \u201CMKULTRA,\u201D\
      \ the name of a 1960s CIA mind-control program. The context for the tweet was\
      \ not clear.\n\nHer most recent post about QAnon is a retweeted clip of Stephen\
      \ Colbert welcoming then-candidate Donald Trump onto his show. \u201CYou are\
      \ not supposed to see this video,\u201D the video, which is tagged with a QAnon\
      \ hashtag is captioned.\n\nThe clip, in fact, aired during Colbert\u2019s CBS\
      \ show. Barr retweeted it early Thursday. Hours earlier, she and Trump had spoken\
      \ on the phone.\n\nThe QAnon tweets weren\u2019t Barr\u2019s first dabbling\
      \ in conspiracy. A prolific Twitter user, Barr had once retweeted an InfoWars\
      \ report \u201Con the \u20185.7 Million Illegals\u2019 who they baselessly claim\
      \ voted in the presidential election,\u201D The Daily Beast\u2019s Amy Zimmerman\
      \ previously reported. Barr has also pushed conspiracy theories about murdered\
      \ Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, whom some truthers believe\
      \ was killed in a Clinton-ordered hit.\n\nBarr\u2019s politics have also tended\
      \ toward the fringes. In 2009, Barr (who is Jewish) posed for a photoshoot in\
      \ the Jewish youth magazine Heeb, in which she dressed as Hitler eating singed,\
      \ human-shaped \u201CJew cookies.\u201D The magazine, which labeled Barr \u201C\
      the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fuck\u201D later pulled the\
      \ photo spread.\n\nIn 2012, she launched a presidential campaign as a Green\
      \ Party candidate but lost to Jill Stein in the primary. Since then, Barr\u2019\
      s views have veered right with blatantly Islamophobic tweets. In an August 2016\
      \ Twitter rant, she claimed \u201Cjew hater hillary clinton\u2019s handler huma\
      \ weiner is a filthy nazi whore.\u201D"

    text: "The Trump Administration The 45th President and His Administration\n\n\
      In early 2002, as the Bush administration hunted for Osama bin Laden, pressed\
      \ its war in Afghanistan and set its sights on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq, John\
      \ Bolton saw another looming threat: that Cuba was secretly developing biological\
      \ weapons.\n\nBolton, who was then the State Department\u2019s undersecretary\
      \ for arms control issues, included a warning about the Cuban threat in a draft\
      \ of a speech and sent it around the department for the necessary clearance.\
      \ A biological warfare analyst wrote back that Bolton\u2019s proposed comments\
      \ overstated what U.S. intelligence agencies really knew about the matter, and,\
      \ as routinely happens, suggested some small changes.\n\nThe analyst was summoned\
      \ to Bolton\u2019s office. \u201CHe got very red in the face, and shaking his\
      \ finger at me, and explained to me that I was acting way beyond my position,\u201D\
      \ the analyst, Christian Westermann, recalled later during a Senate inquiry.\
      \ Bolton then demanded that Westermann\u2019s supervisor remove him permanently\
      \ from the biological weapons portfolio, thundering that \u201Che wasn\u2019\
      t going to be told what he could say by a mid-level munchkin.\u201D\n\nLast\
      \ week, President Donald Trump named Bolton to be his new national security\
      \ adviser, a job that would arguably make him the government\u2019s most important\
      \ arbiter of competing views on foreign policy and a key judge of what intelligence\
      \ information reaches the president on the most serious threats to national\
      \ security.\n\nThe nomination \u2014 which does not require Senate confirmation\
      \ \u2014 has drawn attention mainly for Bolton\u2019s combative bureaucratic\
      \ style and the hawkish views he has espoused in three Republican administrations\
      \ and as a Fox News analyst. Among other ideas, Bolton has advocated overthrowing\
      \ the Islamic government of Iran, bombing that country\u2019s nuclear facilities,\
      \ and (just last month) taking preemptive military action against North Korea.\n\
      \nBut many foreign policy experts, including some who worked closely with him,\
      \ argue that the more significant issue for Bolton\u2019s new role may be his\
      \ history as a consumer of intelligence that does not conform to his views,\
      \ and the lengths to which he has sometimes gone to try to suppress analyses\
      \ that he sees as wrong or misinformed.\n\nAn examination of Bolton\u2019s record,\
      \ based on interviews with some of his former colleagues and the Senate hearings\
      \ on his nomination in 2005 to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,\
      \ reveal a tendency to aggressively embrace intelligence that supported his\
      \ positions, while discounting information that undercut those views. The confrontations\
      \ that arose from that approach have often been ascribed to partisanship or\
      \ sharp elbows, but even some conservative veterans of the Bush administration\
      \ accused Bolton of exaggerating, minimizing or cherry-picking intelligence\
      \ information to bolster his policy positions, and of retaliating to try to\
      \ silence intelligence professionals with whom he disagreed.\n\nGet ProPublica\u2019\
      s Top Stories by Email\n\n\u201CAnyone who is so cavalier not just with intelligence,\
      \ but with facts, and so ideologically driven, is unfit to be national security\
      \ adviser,\u201D said Robert Hutchings, who dealt extensively with Bolton as\
      \ head of the National Intelligence Council, a high-level agency that synthesizes\
      \ analysis from across the intelligence community to produce strategic assessments\
      \ for policymakers. \u201CHe\u2019s impervious to information that goes against\
      \ his preconceived ideological views.\u201D\n\nBolton declined to comment for\
      \ this article, but he has dismissed such allegations in the past. During the\
      \ contentious hearings on his nomination as Washington\u2019s U.N. envoy in\
      \ 2005, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that his disputes with\
      \ analysts were based on legitimate questions about the quality of information\
      \ they produced, and what Bolton asserted were the analysts\u2019 failures to\
      \ adhere to proper procedures, rather than his ideological views.\n\n\u201C\
      When you lose trust and confidence in somebody in a professional environment,\
      \ it\u2019s a problem, especially when it\u2019s in the intelligence area,\u201D\
      \ Bolton testified. \u201CI didn\u2019t seek to have these people fired, I didn\u2019\
      t seek to have discipline imposed on them, I said, \u2018I\u2019ve lost trust\
      \ in them, and are there other portfolios they could follow.\u2019\u201D\n\n\
      Bolton\u2019s allies acknowledge that his bellicose personality can rub people\
      \ the wrong way. But they said he is often more thoughtful and disciplined in\
      \ private than in public, and they praised his formidable bureaucratic skills\
      \ as essential to the White House post.\n\n\u201CYou cannot say he is not an\
      \ able government actor,\u201D said Stewart Baker, who was general counsel of\
      \ the Bush National Security Agency and of a commission that reviewed intelligence\
      \ issues relating to the Iraq War. \u201CHe knows how government works and knows\
      \ how to make it work toward new goals. Part of the problem he has faced is\
      \ just how sharp he is at debate, at finding problems and articulating them\
      \ in short, pithy phrases and delivering a message the foreign policy establishment\
      \ doesn\u2019t like.\u201D\n\nSince the creation of the National Security Council\
      \ in 1947, the role of the national security adviser has reflected the differing\
      \ power centers and policy views of successive administrations. The job consists\
      \ of two sets of duties, said Richard Haass, a former head of policy planning\
      \ for the State Department. The first is to identify issues requiring the council\u2019\
      s attention, assemble intelligence and analysis, lay out policy options and\
      \ move the government\u2019s security apparatus to necessary decisions. The\
      \ second role is to serve as a private adviser to the president, one who presents\
      \ a range of views from across the government, and counsel on the best course.\
      \ \u201CThe trick is not to let your personal preference and advocacy get in\
      \ your way,\u201D said Haass, who is now the president of the Council on Foreign\
      \ Relations. \u201CNot a lot of people can do that.\u201D\n\nHaass, who worked\
      \ under Brent Scowcroft on the National Security Council staff of George H.W.\
      \ Bush during the first Gulf War, cited Scowcroft as \u201Cthe gold standard\u201D\
      \ for skill, discipline and restraint in the job. \u201CHe was scrupulous in\
      \ being an honest broker,\u201D said Haass. \u201CSo much so that people in\
      \ the Cabinet were willing to let him convey their positions to the president.\u201D\
      \n\nAlthough Haass described Bolton as an intelligent and forceful advocate,\
      \ he said there are questions about his judgment and temperament, especially\
      \ since he will be counseling a president with no previous government or foreign\
      \ policy experience.\n\nBaker, the former NSA lawyer, predicted Bolton will\
      \ be effective at pushing the ensemble of government agencies to implement policy\
      \ decisions. \u201CI expect him to be quite good at that,\u201D Baker said.\
      \ \u201CHe has a good understanding of government behavior. And he\u2019s smart\
      \ and tough and committed to effective action.\u201D\n\nBolton\u2019s approach\
      \ has generated scrutiny over the years. After he was nominated for the United\
      \ Nations job in March of 2005, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee interviewed\
      \ 35 witnesses and reviewed 800 pages of documents and communications from the\
      \ State Department, the CIA and the Agency for International Development. In\
      \ examining Bolton\u2019s tenure as the department\u2019s undersecretary for\
      \ arms control and international security, skeptical Democrats noted that he\
      \ had been a vocal proponent of invading Iraq in 2003 \u2014 and of the faulty\
      \ intelligence that the Bush administration produced about Iraqi weapons of\
      \ mass destruction.\n\nAmong the more stinging voices raised against Bolton\
      \ was that of Hutchings, a veteran diplomat who headed the National Intelligence\
      \ Council from 2003 to 2005. Hutchings told the Senate committee that the intelligence\
      \ community had raised strong objections to congressional testimony that Bolton\
      \ was preparing in the summer of 2003 about the U.S. assessment of Syria\u2019\
      s nascent nuclear program. The intelligence community thought Bolton exaggerated\
      \ the threat of Syrian weapons development, according to Hutchings and Senate\
      \ documents.\n\nRead More Trump, Inc. Exploring the Mysteries of the President\u2019\
      s Businesses\n\nBolton took \u201Cisolated facts and made much more of them\
      \ to build a case than I thought the intelligence warranted,\u201D Hutchings\
      \ said, according to the Senate committee report. \u201CIt was, sort of, cherry-picking\
      \ of little factoids, and little isolated bits were drawn out to present the\
      \ starkest possible case.\u201D\n\nIn response, Bolton described the conflict\
      \ that arose over the Syria issue as part of the standard back-and-forth between\
      \ intelligence agencies and policymakers. Interviewed this week, Hutchings,\
      \ now a professor of national security studies at the University of Texas\u2019\
      \ Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said his opinion about Bolton\
      \ has not changed. He called Trump\u2019s choice of Bolton \u201Cdangerous,\
      \ not just unfortunate,\u201D and warned that it would increase the risk of\
      \ an ill-advised war with North Korea and other adversaries.\n\nThe 2005 Senate\
      \ inquiry also delved into complaints that Bolton pressured and mistreated subordinates\
      \ who differed with him on various intelligence and policy issues. Officials\
      \ testified that Bolton tried to block the promotion of a young official in\
      \ in the State Department\u2019s non-proliferation bureau who had received glowing\
      \ reviews from his superiors. The official, Rexon Ryu, was said to have played\
      \ a role in removing some of the most controversial allegations about Iraq\u2019\
      s weapons programs from a much-criticized speech that Secretary of State Colin\
      \ Powell gave at the U.N. Security Council on the eve of the war.\n\nBolton\u2019\
      s clash with the biological weapons analyst Westermann in 2002 became State\
      \ Department lore. The argument had its origins in Bolton\u2019s view that the\
      \ U.S. intelligence community had gravely underestimated the Cuban threat, in\
      \ part because of the influence of a senior Pentagon intelligence analyst, Ana\
      \ Belen Montes, who was arrested in 2001 on charges of spying for Cuba.\n\n\
      The speech that Bolton submitted for State Department clearance in February\
      \ of 2002 warned of the potential \u201Cdual use\u201D of Cuba\u2019s advanced\
      \ biotechnology industry, according to testimony and interviews. Bolton wanted\
      \ to assert that the U.S. believed Fidel Castro\u2019s government \u201Chas\
      \ a developmental offensive biological warfare program and is providing assistance\
      \ to other rogue state programs,\u201D according to the Senate report.\n\nThat\
      \ language triggered an objection from Westermann, a decorated Navy combat veteran\
      \ and former arms inspector who handled the chemical and biological weapons\
      \ account in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.\
      \ After Westermann raised his concern, the passage was toned down to say that\
      \ the U.S. \u201Cbelieves that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological\
      \ warfare research and development effort. Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology\
      \ to other rogue states. We\u2019re concerned that such technology could support\
      \ BW programs in those states.\u201D\n\nAfter dressing down Westermann, Bolton\
      \ pressed Westermann\u2019s supervisor to remove him from his subject matter\
      \ portfolio \u2014 a move that officials described as tantamount to dismissal.\n\
      \n\u201CPeople stay on their accounts a long time,\u201D a former State Department\
      \ intelligence colleague of Westermann said in an interview. \u201CIf you remove\
      \ him from the account, that means he basically loses his job. Bolton went out\
      \ of his way to bully him. It was beyond the pale.\u201D\n\nOther, more senior\
      \ State Department officials described Bolton\u2019s behavior as unprecedented.\
      \ \u201CAsking me to fire an intelligence analyst is a singular event in my\
      \ career,\u201D former Assistant Secretary Carl Ford, who oversaw the intelligence\
      \ bureau at the time, said in an interview. \u201CThreatening to have someone\
      \ fired for not altering intelligence judgments to suit them, that is uniquely\
      \ Bolton. I have worked in both intelligence and policy positions. Even the\
      \ most opinionated people with reputations of being difficult never even suggested\
      \ they were thinking about doing something so outrageous.\u201D\n\nBolton and\
      \ his defenders said he was angry because the analyst had communicated with\
      \ others about the matter without telling him. They pointed out that Westermann\
      \ kept his job in the end. Nonetheless, news of the harangue spread like wildfire\
      \ in a culture that prides itself on encouraging analysts to provide rigorous,\
      \ unvarnished assessments to policymakers, regardless of their power or politics.\n\
      \nSecretary of State Powell, who was known to criticize Bolton privately, later\
      \ visited the intelligence bureau to show support for Westermann and the other\
      \ analysts, according to interviews and testimony. Westermann\u2019s star rose\
      \ further after it became known that he had been a rare voice of skepticism\
      \ about allegations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Cuba dossier\
      \ triggered another clash only months after the Westermann incident. This time,\
      \ Bolton\u2019s target was a senior CIA analyst, Fulton Armstrong, who was serving\
      \ as the intelligence community\u2019s National Intelligence Officer for Latin\
      \ America. Although Armstrong focused on the Havana regime\u2019s political\
      \ motivations, he and other CIA officers also challenged Bolton\u2019s public\
      \ statements about possible Cuban efforts to develop biological weapons.\n\n\
      \u201CWe all agreed that what Bolton wanted to say was exaggerating to the point\
      \ of cooking the intelligence,\u201D Armstrong recalled in an interview. \u201C\
      No one ever stated that Bolton did not have the right to put out any judgment\
      \ he wanted. Our position was you can say whatever you want, but don\u2019t\
      \ use us to validate it.\u201D\n\nBolton and one of his bureaucratic allies\
      \ Otto Reich, then the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, assailed\
      \ Armstrong, according to testimony and interviews. In July 2002, Bolton drove\
      \ out to the CIA\u2019s Virginia headquarters and demanded that a senior official\
      \ remove Armstrong from his post.\n\nThis time, it was the agency\u2019s deputy\
      \ director, John McLaughlin, who told Bolton, \u201CNo.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
      s perfectly all right for a policymaker to express disagreement,\u201D McLaughlin\
      \ said during the later Senate inquiry. \u201CBut I think it\u2019s different\
      \ to then request, because of the disagreement, that the person be transferred.\
      \ And \u2014 unless there is malfeasance involved here \u2014 and, in this case,\
      \ I had high regard for the individual\u2019s work; therefore, I had a strong\
      \ negative reaction to the suggestion about moving him.\u201D\n\nBolton said\
      \ he had \u201Cone conversation\u201D at the CIA about Armstrong, then did not\
      \ revisit the issue. But interviews and the Senate report indicate that the\
      \ campaign against the Latin America specialist lasted months, if not years.\
      \ One senator described it as \u201Ca vendetta.\u201D Armstrong said the retaliation\
      \ also had a wider, chilling effect, because the national intelligence officer\
      \ speaks for the combined work of 15 agencies.\n\nAs for Bolton himself, the\
      \ Republican-dominated committee voted 10-8 in favor of his nomination. Sen.\
      \ Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the committee chairman, said the cases cited by Bolton\u2019\
      s opponents were overstated. Whatever disputes may have arisen, Bolton \u201C\
      always accepted the final judgment of the intelligence community,\u201D Lugar\
      \ said. In the face of heated opposition to the nomination in the full Senate,\
      \ President Bush gave Bolton a recess appointment.\n\nBolton and other Bush\
      \ administration policy officials continued to insist on the validity of their\
      \ view that Cuba was pursuing a bioweapon research and development program.\
      \ However, by 2005, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that \u201Cit\
      \ is unclear whether Cuba has an active offensive biological warfare effort\
      \ now, or even had one in the past.\u201D\n\nBy 2010, under the Obama administration,\
      \ an annual State Department report on the issue dropped any references to a\
      \ bioweapons threat from Cuba. The \u201Cavailable information did not indicate,\u201D\
      \ the report said, that Cuba was involved in any weapons activities prohibited\
      \ by international agreement."

    text: "Jared Kushner and his attorneys likely did not enjoy something they read\
      \ when the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Russian election\
      \ interference last Thursday. The report, drafted by Chairman Devin Nunes and\
      \ supported by only GOP members of the Committee, has become yet another instance\
      \ of a failure of bipartisan investigations on the Hill. Even one of the leading\
      \ members of the Committee, Republican Trey Gowdy, acknowledged on Fox News\
      \ Sunday that Americans should \u201Cnot have confidence in\u201D the report\u2019\
      s conclusion that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion and should\
      \ have confidence in what Mueller\u2019s investigation produces instead. (Gowdy\
      \ recently announced his retirement from Congress citing his distaste for hyper-partisanism\
      \ in his line of work.) As expected, President Donald Trump took to Twitter\
      \ to tweet his chosen highlights of the Committee\u2019s findings. There was\
      \ plenty for the President to champion. Except.\n\nWhen Kushner read the report\u2019\
      s \u201CFinding #32\u201D he was surely disappointed. That\u2019s because the\
      \ Committee\u2019s stated conclusion contradicts Kushner\u2019s written statement\
      \ to Congress concerning the important June 9 meeting with Russians in Trump\
      \ Tower. The Committee\u2019s finding states that Kushner, Donald Trump Jr.,\
      \ and Paul Manafort attended the meeting \u201Cwhere they expected to receive\u2026\
      derogatory information on candidate Clinton from Russian sources.\u201D\n\n\
      That line in the Committee\u2019s findings is generally consistent with what\
      \ Trump Jr. told Congress he expected to receive at the meeting. It is highly\
      \ inconsistent with what Kushner told Congress.\n\nKushner\u2019s written statement\
      \ to Congress, which his lawyers released publicly, denied that he knew what\
      \ the June 9th meeting was going to be about. That\u2019s at least the most\
      \ plausible, if not universal understanding, of what Kushner wrote (read, for\
      \ example, this line-by-line annotation of Kushner\u2019s statement by former\
      \ federal prosecutor turned defense attorney Renato Mariotti at Just Security).\
      \ Even the most charitable reading of Kushner\u2019s statement is that he did\
      \ not directly and unequivocally state he had no foreknowledge of the meeting\u2019\
      s purpose, but that he nevertheless sought to leave the clear impression, with\
      \ Congress and the public, that he did not know the purpose of the meeting before\
      \ attending.\n\nKushner\u2019s statement, for instance, goes to great lengths\
      \ to establish that he did not read the contents of the Trump Jr. email setting\
      \ up the meeting until it was shown to him by his lawyers. For instance, Kushner\u2019\
      s statement to Congress said:\n\n\u201CThat email was on top of a long back\
      \ and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when\
      \ I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message\
      \ that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my\
      \ memory that this was calendared as \u2018Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.\u2019\
      \ No one else was mentioned.\u201D \u201CI did not read or recall this email\
      \ exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents\
      \ for submission to the committees.\u201D \u201C[I]t was typical for me to receive\
      \ 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read\
      \ every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to\
      \ which I was added at some later point in the exchange.\u201D\n\nThe contradiction\
      \ between Kushner\u2019s statement and \u201CFinding #32\u201D is so stark and\
      \ the Nunes investigation so biased that it is theoretically possible the discrepancy\
      \ could be boiled down to a drafting error on the part of the Committee\u2014\
      I suppose. Another alternative is that among the forty-four findings, the GOP\
      \ members did not realize one of these materially differed from Kushner\u2019\
      s specific account.\n\nThe implication is fairly clear: there\u2019s a high\
      \ likelihood Kushner\u2019s submitted statements of fact that the House Committee\
      \ has determined to be false\u2013perhaps without the GOP committee members\u2019\
      \ realizing the contradiction.\n\nThe federal crime of intentionally making\
      \ false statements to Congress is written broadly. It applies to anyone who\
      \ \u201Cknowingly and willfully\u201D:\n\n(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers\
      \ up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially\
      \ false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.\n\nThere is\
      \ no question that Kushner was seeking to create an understanding that he did\
      \ not know the purpose of the Trump Tower meeting. As long as the Committee\u2019\
      s finding remains, the burden is on Kushner to explain his statement which he\
      \ and his lawyers decided to release to the public."

      \ conglomerate with massive holdings in aluminum, energy, and construction.\
      \ With an estimated net worth of $6 billion, he can afford to send a private\
      \ jet across the globe whenever he wants.\n\nStill, according to a source familiar\
      \ with the matter, that August flight has caught the attention of congressional\
      \ investigators, in part because of its timing.\n\nThe jet arrived within hours\
      \ of a meeting in nearby Manhattan between Paul Manafort, then chairman of Donald\
      \ Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik spent\
      \ over a decade as Manafort\u2019s translator and fixer in Ukraine. Weeks earlier,\
      \ Manafort had emailed his old associate and told him to extend an offer of\
      \ \"private briefings\" to Deripaska, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\
      Congressional investigators looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 election\
      \ are now probing the relationship between Manafort, Kilimnik, and Deripaska,\
      \ according to two people familiar with the matter. The jet\u2019s brief trip\
      \ to New Jersey raises fresh questions about the relationship between the three\
      \ men during the 2016 presidential campaign. Deripaska is believed to have close\
      \ ties with the Kremlin. Kilimnik has been widely reported to be the unnamed\
      \ person identified in court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller's office\
      \ this week as having ties to Russian intelligence \u2014 a relationship Kilimnik\
      \ has long denied.\n\nManafort has since been named in a 32-count indictment\
      \ by Mueller\u2019s team on charges including bank fraud and filing false tax\
      \ returns related to his work for the former government of Ukraine.\n\nA spokesperson\
      \ for Deripaska confirmed the Gulfstream jet\u2019s flight to New Jersey to\
      \ VICE News, but said the trip had nothing to do with Manafort\u2019s offer\
      \ of briefings, which the spokesperson said Deripaska never received. \u201C\
      The passengers of the flights during the time period in early August 2016 were\
      \ Mr. Deripaska\u2019s family only,\u201D the spokesperson, who asked not to\
      \ be named, wrote in an email to VICE News. \u201CAs it was previously stated,\
      \ Mr. Deripaska had no communications, meetings, briefings, or other interaction\
      \ with Mr. Manafort during, after, or in the run-up to the 2016 Presidential\
      \ Election. Thus, we repeat that any publications implying that Mr. Deripaska\
      \ directly or indirectly communicated with Mr. Manafort in 2016 would be a false\
      \ statement of fact.\u201D\n\n\u201CPerson A has ties to a Russian intelligence\
      \ service \u201D\n\nOn Tuesday night, prosecutors working for Mueller released\
      \ a court filing saying that an unnamed associate of Manafort\u2019s \u201C\
      has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\u201D\
      \ According to the filing, Rick Gates, who held various senior positions in\
      \ the Trump campaign and was Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner, said\
      \ the associate \u201Cwas a former Russian Intelligence Officer with the GRU,\u201D\
      \ Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency. The associate, referred to simply\
      \ as \u201CPerson A,\u201D isn\u2019t identified, but the detailed description\
      \ provided by prosecutors lines up closely with Konstantin Kilimnik.\n\nKilimnik\
      \ didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment, and two people who know\
      \ him, including a reporter in Ukraine who was in touch with Kilimnik in 2017,\
      \ told VICE News that he has stopped responding to requests for interviews in\
      \ recent months. Yet Kilimnik is known to have been in direct email contact\
      \ with Manafort as recently as late November 2017, according to court filings\
      \ by Mueller\u2019s team. Gates had repeated contacts with \u201CPerson A\u201D\
      \ during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, according to the special counsel\
      \ filing. In February, Gates pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and lying\
      \ to the FBI, and struck a deal to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation.\n\
      \nPeter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, declined to comment\
      \ to VICE News for this story.\n\nIn the past, Kilimnik has strenuously denied\
      \ any link to Russian intelligence, once telling The Washington Post, in a statement\
      \ relayed by Manafort\u2019s attorney, that although he did serve as a Russian\
      \ military translator in the early 1990s, he has \u201Cno relation to the Russian\
      \ or any other intelligence service.\u201D\n\nPeople who know Kilimnik describe\
      \ him as highly intelligent and a smooth operator who speaks good English and\
      \ Swedish, and they say he\u2019s very well connected in Ukrainian and Russian\
      \ political and business circles. Those sources say he\u2019s been on good terms\
      \ with the staff of the U.S. embassy in Kiev.\n\nManafort\u2019s \u201Cright\
      \ hand\u2026 in Kiev\u201D\n\nA former Ukrainian government official who has\
      \ known both Manafort and Kilimnik for years described Kilimnik to VICE News\
      \ as Manafort\u2019s \u201Cright hand\u2026 in Kiev.\u201D He said Kilimnik\
      \ \u201Ctranslated for him [Manafort] at all high-level meetings.\u201D\n\n\
      The former official continued: \u201CI know that Kilimnik used to be a welcome\
      \ guest in [the] U.S. embassy, and no one then evidently suspected him of being\
      \ a Russian spy.\u201D American diplomats and foreign policy officials confirmed\
      \ that Kilimnik was a familiar presence in American diplomatic circles.\n\n\
      According to a story in Politico last year, after he returned from meeting Manafort\
      \ in Manhattan in August 2016, Kilimnik suggested to an unnamed associate in\
      \ Ukraine that he had helped remove language from the Republican Party platform\
      \ that would have laid out a tougher stance toward Russia.\n\nA proposed amendment\
      \ called for the U.S. to provide \u201Clethal defensive weapons\u201D for Ukraine\
      \ to defend itself against Russia. Mueller\u2019s team is now probing how the\
      \ phrase came to be removed from the platform in July 2016 at the Republican\
      \ National Convention, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201CHe led me to believe that\
      \ he was involved in the platform fight, but not necessarily through Paul,\u201D\
      \ a Kiev-based operative, described as someone who \u201Ctravels in the same\
      \ circles\u201D as Kilimnik, told Politico. But the person added that Kilimnik\
      \ could have been \u201Cjust bullshitting like political consultants do.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CProvided that he buys me a ticket\u201D\n\nOn July 7, 2016, months\
      \ after he joined the Trump campaign, Manafort emailed Kilimnik with a message\
      \ to pass on to Deripaska. Years earlier, Manafort provided Deripaska with investment\
      \ and consulting services before their business relationship soured. In January,\
      \ a company controlled and funded by Deripaska sued Manafort and Gates for at\
      \ least $25 million in damages connected to a failed joint cable and internet\
      \ venture in Ukraine, according to court documents.\n\n\u201CTell V boss that\
      \ if he needs private briefings, we can accommodate,\u201D Manafort told Kilimnik,\
      \ according to an exchange reported in The Atlantic. According to that report,\
      \ \u201CV\u201D was an aide to Deripaska named Victor.\n\nManafort\u2019s spokesman,\
      \ Jason Maloni, has confirmed that the reported emails between Manafort and\
      \ Kilimnik are legitimate. But he\u2019s called the email exchange \u201Cinnocuous,\u201D\
      \ and said that the briefings never occurred.\n\nOn July 29, Kilimnik sent an\
      \ email to Manafort with the subject line \u201CBlack Caviar\u201D proposing\
      \ the two men meet in person. Kilimnik wrote that he had \u201Cimportant messages\u201D\
      \ to deliver to Manafort from an unnamed person, \u201Cprovided that he buys\
      \ me a ticket.\u201D\n\n\u201CI met today with the guy who gave you your biggest\
      \ black caviar jar several years ago,\u201D Kilimnik wrote, according to The\
      \ Atlantic report. \u201CWe spent about 5 hours talking about his story, and\
      \ I have several important messages from him to you. He asked me to go and brief\
      \ you on our conversation. I said I have to run it by you first, but in principle\
      \ I am prepared to do it, provided that he buys me a ticket. It has to do about\
      \ the future of his country, and is quite interesting. So, if you are not absolutely\
      \ against the concept, please let me know which dates/places will work, even\
      \ next week, and I could come and see you.\u201D\n\nManafort reportedly wrote\
      \ back: \u201CTuesday is best.\u201D\n\nThe next Tuesday was August 2.\n\nPrevious\
      \ press reports have given the date of Manafort and Kilimnik\u2019s meeting\
      \ in Manhattan\u2019s Grand Havana Room cigar club as August 2, or \"about two\
      \ weeks before Manafort resigned\" from the Trump campaign, which happened on\
      \ August 19. Sources who spoke to VICE News have not been able to confirm the\
      \ exact date of the meeting in early August 2016.\n\nThe private Gulfstream\
      \ jet that landed in Newark after midnight on August 3 has been previously linked\
      \ to Deripaska by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an investigative\
      \ video released in February. That video purports to show Deripaska meeting\
      \ with a high-level Russian government official on a yacht off the coast of\
      \ Norway within days of the plane\u2019s return to Moscow. Deripaska has dismissed\
      \ the video\u2019s claims as \u201Cfalse\u201D and \u201Coutrageous,\u201D and\
      \ \u201Cthe result of a planned campaign aiming to damage my reputation.\u201D\
      \n\nThe spokesperson for Deripaska confirmed the plane\u2019s flights in August\
      \ 2016 but didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions from VICE News about whether\
      \ the billionaire actually owns the plane. In the documentary, Navalny tracks\
      \ the jet, and uses Instagram posts and other publicly available information\
      \ to present evidence of what he claims was a meeting between Deripaska and\
      \ Russian deputy prime minister Sergei Prikhodko on a yacht off the Norwegian\
      \ coast on the weekend after flight records show the jet returned from Newark.\n\
      \nThe fact that the M-ALAY jet made a brief trip to New Jersey in early August\
      \ 2016 was pointed out in a Medium blog post by a young independent journalist\
      \ and UC Irvine senior named Scott Stedman in early March, and then picked up\
      \ by independent Russia-focused outlet The Bell.\n\nBoth Manafort and Kilimnik\
      \ have denied that their discussion in early August was directly related to\
      \ the upcoming U.S. election. In June 2017, Kilimnik told the Post that he and\
      \ Manafort discussed \u201Cunpaid bills\u201D and \u201Ccurrent news,\u201D\
      \ and that their talk was \u201Cin no way related to politics or the presidential\
      \ campaign in the U.S.\u201D\n\nMaloni, Manafort\u2019s spokesman, has said\
      \ that \u201Cit would be neither surprising nor suspicious that two political\
      \ consultants would chat about the political news of the day, including the\
      \ DNC hack, which was in the news.\u201D\n\nMaloni declined to comment on the\
      \ record to VICE News for this story.\n\nIn text messages with a reporter for\
      \ Radio Free Liberty/Radio Europe last fall, Kilimnik said his conversations\
      \ with Manafort over the many years they worked together had been wide-ranging.\n\
      \n\"There were millions of emails. [...] we worked for 11 years. And we discussed\
      \ a lot of issues, from Putin to women,\" Kilimnik reportedly wrote. \"Of course\
      \ we discussed Trump and everything,\" he said in another message.\n\nIn those\
      \ texts, Kilimnik went on to deny any links to Russian intelligence. And Kilimnik\
      \ worried about the fate of his longtime acquaintance Manafort as Mueller\u2019\
      s investigation into Russia\u2019s involvement in the election closed in on\
      \ him.\n\n\u201COn the political side there is no case that can be made about\
      \ my involvement in the U.S. elections,\" Kilimnik reportedly wrote to a journalist\
      \ in a text on Sept. 21, 2017. \u201CThey are tough investigators and probably\
      \ will get manafort for some financial crap. With that many years of international\
      \ clients no one can be 100% clean.\u201D"

    text: "What's happening: Per the Washington Post , administration officials, who\
      \ were thrown off balance when China announced it had held its own summit with\
      \ Kim, debated the implications of the meeting but ultimately decided to declare\
      \ it a positive result of its \u201Cmaximum pressure\u201D campaign against\
      \ North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s journey to Beijing this\
      \ week appears to have come as a surprise to the Trump administration but the\
      \ White House seems to be spinning it as a positive development.\n\nBig questions:\
      \ Why Kim made the trip now \u2014 and what will he get from China in return\
      \ \u2014 are among the key questions surrounding the visit. According to data\
      \ released Friday, China may have been squeezing North Korea even harder than\
      \ required under the current UN sanctions regime. The Financial Times reports\
      \ that several Chinese exports to North Korea showed recent significant drops:\n\
      \nThe monthly average of refined petroleum exports in January and February was\
      \ 175.2 tons \u2014 1.3% of the monthly average of 13,552.6 tons shipped in\
      \ the first half of 2017.\n\nCoal exports were cut to zero in the 3 months ending\
      \ Feb. 28 \u2014 after running a monthly average of 8,627 tons the first half\
      \ of 2017.\n\nSteel exports ran at an monthly average of 257 tons in the first\
      \ 2 months of this year \u2014 down from a monthly average of 15,110 tons in\
      \ the first half of 2017.\n\nWhy it matters: China has reminded everyone that\
      \ it still has significant influence over North Korea, and that all roads to\
      \ a solution will have to run through Beijing. Now that Kim has paid proper\
      \ tribute to China President Xi Jinping, will China back off on some of the\
      \ pressure?\n\nGo deeper: Former State official P.J. Crowley writes for Axios'\
      \ Expert Voices that Kim's diplomatic offensive upends U.S. policy. The Korean\
      \ Central TV has a documentary with English voiceover on the visit, now on YouTube,\
      \ and it's a fascinating look at an alternate, fraternal Socialist universe.\n\
      \nBe smart: Some skepticism may be needed about the upcoming U.S.-North Korea\
      \ meetings. North Korea has talked about denuclearizing before, but always with\
      \ conditions that effectively include removal of U.S. troops from South Korea\
      \ and the destruction of the U.S. alliance system in Asia.\n\nAnd, don't forget\
      \ \u2014 in 2009, NYT reported that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he\
      \ was \u201Ctired of buying the same horse twice\u201D in reference to another\
      \ deal with the DPRK.\n\nSeparately, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency reports via\
      \ Reuters that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is to visit Russia on April\
      \ 4 and 5 \u2014 and I am now hearing a rumor that Kim will visit Russia soon\
      \ after."

      Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to President Trump, told former Trump
      aide Sam Nunberg in 2016 that he had met with Wikileaks leader Julian Assange
      in London, Nunberg told The Washington Post on Tuesday.


      Another Stone associate also confirmed to the paper that Stone had made those
      claims.


      Nunberg told the Post that investigators working for special counsel Robert
      Mueller asked him about that conversation with Stone. Investigators are looking
      into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian operatives to swing the
      2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russians stole
      emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chair
      John Podesta and gave them to Wikileaks, which released them during the campaign.


      Stone told the Post that he had made the comments in jest in order to get off
      the phone with Nunberg.


      In a series of increasingly-bizarre TV interviews last Monday, Nunberg maintained
      that he would not cooperate with Mueller, only to change his mind and appear
      before a grand jury on Friday.


      Nunberg was fired from the Trump campaign in 2015 over a series of racist Facebook
      posts.

      \ two national monuments in Utah. After he had finished, staff did a final legal\
      \ review of a webpage they had prepared earlier and published it.\n\nOn Patagonia\u2019\
      s site, the words \u201CThe President Stole Your Land\u201D appeared in large\
      \ white letters against a black background.\n\nYosemite's secretive Starbucks:\
      \ cafe opens in park, to delight and dismay Read more\n\n\u201CWe were flattered\
      \ with how viral it went and how provocative it ended up being,\u201D said John\
      \ Goodwin, brand creative director for Patagonia.\n\nOn Thursday, Patagonia\
      \ lobbed another volley in the fight for public lands: that message reappeared\
      \ on the Patagonia homepage, with the addition of \u201Cand You Were Lied To\u201D\
      . An accompanying blogpost calls the monument reductions \u201Cdeliberate and\
      \ directly influenced\u201D by the energy industry.\n\nIn a lot of industries,\
      \ mixing business and politics so blatantly might seem taboo. But when it comes\
      \ to America\u2019s protected landscapes, outdoor companies have determined\
      \ that the benefits far outweigh the risks and launched an unprecedented effort\
      \ opposing the Trump administration. In the face of efforts to open up public\
      \ land to mining and drilling, big outdoors has begun to flex its muscles.\n\
      \n\u201CWhat we have to do as an industry,\u201D said Peter Metcalf, the founder\
      \ and recently retired CEO of the climbing company Black Diamond Equipment,\
      \ \u201Cis organize in the same way that the NRA and the right-to-lifers have,\
      \ and make public lands a primary, binary voting issue.\u201D\n\nSign up for\
      \ monthly updates on America\u2019s public lands.\n\nThe outdoor industry, like\
      \ many others, is confronting the emerging reality that under Trump, US consumers\
      \ are looking more and more to brands to take a stand. To the extent that companies\
      \ are adopting more radical positions than they have historically, \u201Cthat\u2019\
      s probably a direct reflection of the radicalism, in the other direction, of\
      \ the Trump administration,\u201D said Marina Welker, associate professor of\
      \ anthropology at Cornell, whose research focuses on the ethical relationship\
      \ between business and society.\n\nThis has perhaps been most publicly visible\
      \ in the gun debate, in which even generally conservative companies such as\
      \ Walmart are taking action that goes against the administration. That debate\
      \ has also made ripples in the outdoor industry: in early March, REI put a hold\
      \ on orders from Vista Outdoor, a supplier that owns brands including the water\
      \ bottle and hydration-pack manufacturer CamelBak but earns the bulk of its\
      \ profits on guns and ammunition.\n\nFor companies like Patagonia and REI, whose\
      \ employees and customers tend to share the \u201Ccrunchiness\u201D associated\
      \ with conservation values and a passion for the outdoors, coming out strongly\
      \ against the administration\u2019s attacks on public lands was a natural next\
      \ step. What\u2019s more surprising, however, is the unified way the whole sector\
      \ has mobilized. Companies that have long been engaged with these issues have\
      \ turned up the volume on their advocacy, while companies that hadn\u2019t previously\
      \ taken a strong stance have begun reaching out to their customers.\n\n\u201C\
      For our industry, it didn\u2019t take a lot of discussion,\u201D said Amy Roberts,\
      \ executive director of Outdoor Industry Association, which represents more\
      \ than 1,200 outdoor businesses. The fact that the outdoor industry can now\
      \ make an economic argument for the value of public lands \u2013 a recent report\
      \ from the Outdoor Industry Association says the outdoor recreation economy\
      \ generates $887bn a year \u2013 has also increased its political clout.\n\n\
      The first sign that the industry was mobilizing in a serious way came shortly\
      \ after Trump was elected. With the backing of prominent brands including Patagonia,\
      \ REI and the North Face, the Outdoor Retailer trade show pulled out of its\
      \ longtime home in Salt Lake City following an unsuccessful effort to convince\
      \ the Utah governor, Gary Herbert, to reconsider his position on multiple public\
      \ lands issues.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Patagonia has sued the administration\
      \ over the reductions of Utah national monuments. Photograph: Patagonia\n\n\
      Since then, outdoor companies have lent their support by donating money, getting\
      \ the word out and, in Patagonia\u2019s case, suing the administration over\
      \ the reductions of Utah\u2019s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national\
      \ monuments by about 2m acres. The North Face, Osprey Packs, Black Diamond,\
      \ and several other companies were founding partners on a project to build a\
      \ new Bears Ears education center. Patagonia recently launched a new activism\
      \ hub, Action Works, with the goal of helping people get involved with environmental\
      \ issues near where they live.\n\n\u201CWe saw Utah\u2019s lawmakers continue\
      \ to threaten places that are invaluable to our environment, communities, and\
      \ economy,\u201D Arne Arens, president of the North Face, said in a statement.\
      \ \u201CWhen it came to taking a stand on Bears Ears last year,\u201D he explained,\
      \ \u201Cwe were most worried about ramifications if we didn\u2019t do something.\u201D\
      \n\nThe decision to take any kind of political stance carries risks. When Keen\
      \ launched its Live Monumental campaign in 2015, the outdoor footwear brand\
      \ experienced this firsthand. The campaign sought protection for five different\
      \ landscapes, and the company\u2019s support for one of them \u2013 Oregon\u2019\
      s Owyhee Canyonlands \u2013 touched a nerve with some customers.\n\nAs a producer\
      \ of footwear for construction and ranching as well as hiking and boating, Keen\
      \ has a broad customer base, and retailers from the surrounding region reported\
      \ negative feedback from a few customers. \u201CIt blew over for the most part,\u201D\
      \ said Erin Gaines, Keen advocacy manager, though she added that a couple of\
      \ retailers from the area surrounding the Owyhee did sever their relationships\
      \ with the company as a result.\n\nTrees older than America: a primeval Alaskan\
      \ forest is at risk in the Trump era Read more\n\nYet Keen\u2019s takeaway from\
      \ the experience is one that has since resonated throughout the industry: the\
      \ support far outweighed the backlash.\n\nJohn Sterling, executive director\
      \ of the Conservation Alliance, which collects dues from outdoor companies to\
      \ fund grassroots conservation efforts, said the mobilization of outdoors companies\
      \ only appears extraordinary absent its context. What\u2019s going on is not\
      \ normal, he argued. Never before has a president, in one fell swoop, stripped\
      \ protections from 2m acres.\n\n\u201CThe election and the politics that have\
      \ followed have been a direct assault on the lands that mean so much to the\
      \ outdoor industry,\u201D said Sterling. \u201CThe response right now is at\
      \ the scale of the threat.\u201D"

      \ there is widespread frustration among conservatives, who have been sounding\
      \ the alarm about allegations of anti-Trump bias at the FBI and DOJ for months.There\
      \ is a sense on the right that Sessions is getting pushed around by career law\
      \ enforcement officials who are seeking to protect their own.In a Thursday night\
      \ interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201CThe Ingraham Angle,\u201D Rep.(R-N.C.),\
      \ the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, accused the DOJ of ignoring congressional\

      \ Meadows said. \u201CI disagree with the attorney general. \u2026 The Justice\
      \ Department is not complying with the subpoena and oversight responsibility\
      \ we have in Congress, so for the attorney general to say there\u2019s not enough\
      \ there is extremely disappointing.\u201DRepublicans have alleged that the so-called\
      \ Steele dossier, which was paid for by Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic\
      \ National Committee, was improperly used to obtain a warrant to spy on a Trump\
      \ campaign official. They say the FBI and DOJ hid from the surveillance court\
      \ that the information had been paid for by Democrats.Former FBI Director, whose\
      \ firing by Trump prompted the appointment of special counsel, and Deputy Attorney\
      \ General, who is now overseeing Mueller\u2019s probe, are among those who signed\
      \ off on the warrant applications.Republicans also believe former Deputy FBI\
      \ Directorhas lied to investigators under oath about his contacts with the media,\
      \ which may have contributed to his firing.Jordan said he\u2019d seen evidence\
      \ that McCabe had lied four times about his authorization to speak with the\
      \ media, including to Comey, the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility\
      \ (OPR), and twice under oath to the FBI\u2019s inspector general. Sessions\
      \ fired McCabe earlier this month after the OPR recommended he do so.McCabe,\
      \ who is friends with Comey, was previously at the center of controversy for\
      \ leading the investigation into the Clinton matter, even after his wife received\
      \ a sizable political donation from former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D),\
      \ a Clinton ally.After the firing, it was revealed that McCabe had launched\
      \ an investigation into Sessions over whether the attorney general had lied\
      \ about his contacts with Russians.A report from DOJ Inspector General Michael\
      \ Horowitz, who is now working with Huber, is coming soon and expected to be\
      \ highly critical of McCabe. The Horowitz report is expected to be the definitive\
      \ take on the FBI and DOJ\u2019s handling of the Clinton investigation.But Republicans\
      \ are also eager to investigate FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Strzok\
      \ was a key agent involved in the separate probes into Clinton and Trump. He\
      \ interviewed Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who\
      \ later plead guilty to lying to the FBI.In private text messages, Strzok and\
      \ Page \u2014 who were having an extramarital affair \u2014 were critical of\
      \ Trump, as well as other politicians. Both were removed last year from Mueller\u2019\
      s team.And Republicans want to look into Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who\
      \ is married to a woman who worked for Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm\
      \ that paid a former British spy to compile the anti-Trump dosser.\u201CIf this\
      \ doesn\u2019t represent extraordinary circumstances, then what the heck does,\
      \ Mr. Sessions?\u201D Jordan said.Still, some legal experts are calling on Republicans\
      \ to pump the brakes on their criticism of Sessions.They say that Huber will\
      \ bring subpoena and grand jury power to Horowitz\u2019s investigation, potentially\
      \ laying the groundwork for actions against current and former DOJ and FBI officials,\
      \ or even a second special counsel down the road.\u201CWhat [Sessions] did is\
      \ he essentially combined the powers of the inspector general with the powers\
      \ of a line prosecutor,\u201D Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington\
      \ University and contributor for The Hill, said on Fox News Channel.\u201CThis\
      \ prosecutor does have not just the experience and training to look for a criminal\
      \ case, he has the ability to move a case of that kind. Moreover, if he finds\
      \ that crimes were committed and many people of the FBI might be implicated,\
      \ Sessions reserved the right to go ahead and appoint a special counsel,\" Turley\
      \ said. \"That's a powerful combination.\u201DBut conservatives are fed up by\
      \ what they see as inaction and feckless leadership by Sessions, who they blame\
      \ for exposing the president to rogue actions by law enforcement officials.\u201C\
      Sessions is trying to take the pressure off of himself by appointing Huber,\
      \ but Huber was appointed by Obama and nobody believes he\u2019s going to take\
      \ strong action against his own agency,\u201D said conservative lawyer Larry\

    text: "Seattle-based ABC affiliate KOMO-TV says its owner, the conservative-leaning\
      \ Sinclair Broadcast Group, is forcing its reporters to air pre-scripted segments\
      \ about fake news media, in an attempt to undermine non-Sinclair stations.\n\
      \nSinclair has long produced \u201Cmust-run\u201D segments for its stations,\
      \ dispersing them to its various subsidiaries and requiring the local stations\
      \ to run controversial, typically conservative commentary promos alongside their\
      \ regular news coverage. However, in recent weeks, it\u2019s begun turning its\
      \ sights on the competition, throwing in mentions of \u201Cfake news,\u201D\
      \ among other things.\n\n\u201CThe promos, which began airing on the station\
      \ last week, are part of a Sinclair campaign that forces local anchors to read\
      \ Sinclair-written scripts warning of the dangers of \u2018one-sided news stories\
      \ plaguing our country,'\u201D the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported on Thursday.\n\
      \nThe Post-Intelligencer published one of the scripts this week; in it, the\
      \ authors lament the \u201Ctrend of irresponsible, one sided news stories\u201D\
      \ and the \u201Csharing of biased and false news,\u201D referencing President\
      \ Trump\u2019s preferred term for the press, \u201Cfake news.\u201D\n\nThe full\
      \ script reads:\n\nHi, I\u2019m(A) ____________, and I\u2019m (B) _________________\u2026\
      \ (B) Our greatest responsibility is to serve our Northwest communities. We\
      \ are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that KOMO News produces.\
      \ (A) But we\u2019re concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one\
      \ sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news\
      \ has become all too common on social media. (B) More alarming, some media outlets\
      \ publish these same fake stories\u2026 stories that just aren\u2019t true,\
      \ without checking facts first. (A) Unfortunately, some members of the media\
      \ use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control\
      \ \u2018exactly what people think\u2019\u2026This is extremely dangerous to\
      \ a democracy. (B) At KOMO it\u2019s our responsibility to pursue and report\
      \ the truth. We understand Truth is neither politically \u2018left nor right.\u2019\
      \ Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility,\
      \ now more than ever. (A) But we are human and sometimes our reporting might\
      \ fall short. If you believe our coverage is unfair please reach out to us by\
      \ going to KOMOnews.com and clicking on CONTENT CONCERNS. We value your comments.\
      \ We will respond back to you. (B) We work very hard to seek the truth and strive\
      \ to be fair, balanced and factual\u2026 We consider it our honor, our privilege\
      \ to responsibly deliver the news every day. (A) Thank you for watching and\
      \ we appreciate your feedback.\n\nThe script\u2019s authors provide no proof\
      \ to back their claim that mainstream news outlets are intentionally running\
      \ false stories without fact-checking first. More alarmingly, they do not specifically\
      \ cite which media members are supposedly attempting to \u201Ccontrol\u201D\
      \ the way the public thinks, despite casting a wide net and claiming that certain\
      \ journalists pose a threat to democracy.\n\nAccording to the Post-Intelligencer,\
      \ employees at Sinclair-owned stations were upset about the script.\n\n\u201C\
      They\u2019re certainly not happy about it. It\u2019s certainly a forced thing,\u201D\
      \ one KOMO employee told the outlet.\n\nSinclair regularly runs disinformation\
      \ segments favorable to President Trump: one of its staples is a recurring pre-taped\
      \ segment featuring Sinclair\u2019s chief political analyst, Russian-born former\
      \ Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. As ThinkProgress previously reported, those\
      \ segments frequently include misleading talking points and misinformation from\
      \ the Trump administration, packaged as actual political analysis and news coverage.\n\
      \nAnother previously recurring segment, \u201CBehind the Headlines\u201D with\
      \ Mark Hyman, Sinclair\u2019s vice president for corporate relations, frequently\
      \ parroted administration talking points on controversial subjects like health\
      \ care, immigration, free speech, and extremism, functioning as right-wing and\
      \ white nationalist propaganda.\n\nMore recently, Sinclair pushed a must-run\
      \ segment featuring former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka complaining about the\
      \ existence of the so-called \u201CDeep State,\u201D and unelected group of\
      \ government officials who are supposedly manipulating policy and controlling\
      \ the public narrative. The segment was reportedly produced by Sinclair national\
      \ correspondent Kristine Frazao, who previously worked at Russian state-run\
      \ media outlet RT.\n\nIn December, the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner,\
      \ admitted that the Trump campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair during the\
      \ 2016 election in order to obtain more favorable coverage. Scott Livingston,\
      \ Sinclair\u2019s vice president of news, later told Politico that the company\
      \ had offered a similar deal to Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, but said\
      \ that Clinton declined.\n\n\u201COur commitment to our viewers is to go beyond\
      \ the podium, beyond the rhetoric. We\u2019re all about tracking the truth and\
      \ telling the truth and that\u2019s typically missing in most political coverage,\u201D\
      \ he said at the time.\n\nSinclair is currently awaiting approval on it\u2019\
      s proposed purchase of Tribune Media, which owns or operates 42 broadcast television\
      \ stations in 33 markets, according to its official FCC filing. If the purchase\
      \ is approved, Sinclair will be able to broadcast to at least 70 percent of\
      \ American households."

      \ the U.S. government. Trump has repeatedly complained about such a mysterious\

      \ the segment. Before joining Sinclair in 2013, she was an anchor/correspondent\
      \ at RT, formerly Russia Today, for more than three years, according to her\
      \ LinkedIn page. RT is an international television network funded by the Russian\

      \ exists\u2014but only after the term was defined \"as a group of unelected\

      \ an online news outlet that has a content-sharing agreement with the local\
      \ Sinclair-owned station KOMO.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing\

    text: "Two reasons could explain Laura Ingraham's decision to mock Parkland shooting\
      \ survivor David Hogg for his college rejections. One is schadenfreude, but\
      \ it is seems overly cynical to think that the Fox News host takes pleasure\
      \ in watching more bad things happen to a teenager who lost 14 schoolmates and\
      \ three educators last month.\n\nThe other, more plausible reason is that Ingraham\
      \ wants to remove Hogg from a national conversation about gun control. Rather\
      \ than debate him, she would prefer to disqualify him.\n\n[ Facing boycott,\
      \ Laura Ingraham apologizes for taunting Parkland teen over college rejections\
      \ ]\n\nOn her show last week, Ingraham described Hogg's commentary as a \u201C\
      tantrum\u201D \u2014 a jab at his youth \u2014 while complaining that in \u201C\
      the mainstream media, it's practically a coronation of the new leftist heroes,\
      \ the kids who have become the public face of the movement.\u201D\n\nOn Monday,\
      \ Ingraham played part of Hogg's remarks at Saturday's March for Our Lives in\
      \ Washington, in which he said, \u201CTo those politicians supported by the\
      \ NRA that allow the continued slaughter of our children and our future, I say,\
      \ 'Get your r\xE9sum\xE9s ready.' \u201D\n\n\u201CWho wrote that line?\u201D\
      \ Ingraham asked, suggesting that Hogg could not have composed such a clever\
      \ quip.\n\nIngraham's steady implication has been that Hogg is not as impressive\
      \ as he has been portrayed elsewhere by the media. Her tweet Wednesday that\
      \ taunted Hogg for failing to get into four colleges (he was accepted by three\
      \ others) was one more way for Ingraham to signal that Hogg is overrated and\
      \ unqualified to opine about public policy.\n\nDavid Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges\
      \ To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally\
      \ predictable given acceptance rates.) https://t.co/wflA4hWHXY \u2014 Laura\
      \ Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 28, 2018\n\nIngraham's effort to marginalize\
      \ Hogg does not mean that she is afraid to debate him. Ingraham is a lawyer,\
      \ and even the best lawyers \u2014 no matter how strong their arguments \u2014\
      \ would rather see cases dismissed because opponents lack standing than try\
      \ to win on the merits.\n\nThen again, we are talking about cable news, not\
      \ a courtroom. Yet Ingraham \u2014 author of a book called \u201CShut Up and\
      \ Sing\u201D \u2014 often attacks opponents' standing instead of their substance.\n\
      \nWhen NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant suggested last month that President\
      \ Trump is racist, Ingraham did not make the case that the label is unfair;\
      \ she told the players to \u201Cshut up and dribble.\u201D\n\n\u201CKeep the\
      \ political commentary to yourself,\u201D she added, while calling their comments\
      \ \u201Cbarely intelligible\u201D and \u201Cungrammatical.\u201D\n\nA day later,\
      \ responding to criticism of her comments by the players and others, Ingraham\
      \ said that \u201Cif you want to be a political pundit, you're coming on my\
      \ court. Let's do it. Let's have a real conversation about black unemployment.\
      \ Let's talk about violence in the inner city. Let's talk about all the issues\
      \ like school choice. Let's do it. Don't think you're not going to get criticized\
      \ if all you do is a drive-by hit on Trump and say he's no leader.\u201D\n\n\
      Suddenly Ingraham was game to debate. But her first move had been to assert\
      \ that James and Durant should not participate in political debates.\n\nIngraham\
      \ has taken the same approach to late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, a critic of\
      \ Republican health-care policies.\n\n\u201CLeave it to the pros, Jimmy,\u201D\
      \ she said in December.\n\nAfter this month's Academy Awards ceremony, which\
      \ included political commentary by actors, Ingraham asked her viewers, \u201C\
      Do we watch films and Oscars for them to opine on politics?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
      I think when these actors and celebrities just marinate themselves in politics,\
      \ you can watch us or other networks for that,\u201D she said.\n\nOn Thursday,\
      \ Ingraham apologized to Hogg for \u201Cany upset or hurt my tweet caused\u201D\
      \ and noted that Hogg has appeared on her show before. The interview occurred\
      \ on the day of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and focused\
      \ on basic facts about the event; there was no back-and-forth on gun policy.\n\
      \nIngraham said that Hogg is \u201Cwelcome to return to the show anytime for\
      \ a productive discussion\u201D \u2014 an invitation extended only after she\
      \ cast him as an unworthy adversary.\n\nAny student should be proud of a 4.2\
      \ GPA \u2014incl. @DavidHogg111. On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week,\
      \ I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave\
      \ victims of Parkland. For the record, I believe my show was the first to feature\

      \ completed her sentence and was still serving a three-year supervised release\
      \ period, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Convicted felons lose their\
      \ voting rights in Texas until they complete their full sentences, including\
      \ parole and probation. Mason reportedly told the court, however, that she was\
      \ not aware of that prohibition and had not been informed that she was ineligible\
      \ to vote until her sentence was complete.\n\n\n\n\"She voted in good faith,\"\
      \ Mason's defense attorney J. Warren St. John said in an interview. \"I don't\
      \ think she should be going to prison for that.\" Her attorney has already filed\

      \ which stated that it is a violation of the law to vote if you are a convicted\

      \ ICE should consider if people were victims or witnesses to crimes, or if they\
      \ were seeking civil rights relief, before deciding to deport them. But in 2017,\
      \ the Trump administration rescinded that policy and most other Obama-era immigration\
      \ directives.\n\nSomalia is included in the latest iteration of President Trump's\
      \ controversial travel ban, which severely restricts travel from eight mostly\
      \ majority-Muslim countries to the U.S. His administration also deported 521\
      \ Somalis in fiscal year 2017, up from 198 the period before, according to federal\
      \ data.\n\nPrior to Thursday, the Somalis\u2019 deportation flight was rescheduled,\
      \ and the detainees were moved multiple times. The last-minute changes made\
      \ it difficult for their families to bring them any possessions, according to\
      \ the lawyers involved in the case.\n\n\u201CThey didn\u2019t have anything\
      \ to take with them,\u201D said Fatma Marouf, director of Texas A&M law school\u2019\
      s immigrant rights clinic, which is representing men on the flight. \u201CThey\u2019\
      d arrive in Somalia with no proper shoes, no clothes, no nothing.\u201D\n\n\
      Even the five Somalis who managed to secure last-minute stays are worried. If\
      \ they lose their deportation appeals, they\u2019ll likely be sent back to their\
      \ home country, where al-Shabaab is spreading terror.\n\nOne Somali named Abdullahi,\
      \ for example, fled Mogadishu in 2009 after members of al-Shabaab killed his\
      \ brother and told him \u201CYou\u2019re next,\u201D according to his lawyer.\
      \ After having his birth certificate stolen, and thus having problems identifying\
      \ himself in court, he was denied asylum in the U.S. (Abdullahi\u2019s last\
      \ name has been withheld to protect his identity in the event he loses his appeal\
      \ to stay in the U.S.)\n\nHere's a full copy of Joyce's letter acknowledging\
      \ the investigation:\n\nCover image: Foreign nationals are arrested during a\

      \ to the report, the jet linked to Deripaska landed in New Jersey in August\
      \ 2016, within hours of the meeting between then-Trump campaign chairman Paul\
      \ Manafort and the former Russian military intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik.\
      \ Weeks earlier, Manafort had emailed Kilimnik offering to give Deripaska \u201C\
      private briefings\u201D about the campaign.\n\nThough there was no evidence\
      \ at the time that Deripaska received Manafort\u2019s request or that the briefings\
      \ took place, investigators believed Manafort\u2019s offer created an opening\
      \ that Russia could exploit to gain a foothold in the US election.\n\nFriday\u2019\
      s report sheds light on those events and raises new questions about contacts\
      \ between Deripaska, Manafort, and Kilimnik at the height of the 2016 race.\n\
      \nManafort has acknowledged that he was in frequent contact with Kilimnik while\
      \ serving as the Trump campaign\u2019s chairman, saying he met with Kilimnik\
      \ in May and August 2016. Deripaska\u2019s jet arrived in the US shortly after\
      \ the latter and landed in Newark, New Jersey. It was in the US for less than\
      \ 24 hours, per the report, and the trip has now caught the eye of congressional\
      \ investigators looking into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election.\n\
      \nThe relationship between the three men has also drawn renewed scrutiny in\
      \ recent weeks as special counsel Robert Mueller examines whether members of\
      \ the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the 2016 election in his favour.\n\
      \nThree days before the his meeting with Manafort, Kilimnik wrote in an email\
      \ to the Trump campaign chairman that he had \u201Cmet today with the guy who\
      \ gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago,\u201D a reference\
      \ to Deripaska\u2019s previous loans to Manafort. \u201CWe spent about 5 hours\
      \ talking about his story, and I have several important messages from him to\
      \ you,\u201D he wrote.\n\n\u201CI need about two hours because it is a long\
      \ caviar story to tell,\u201D he added.\n\nManafort said he and Kilimnik discussed\
      \ the Trump campaign and the recent hack of the Democratic National Committee\
      \ during the August 2, 2016 meeting. Kilimnik, meanwhile, said they did not\
      \ discuss the campaign, but talked about \u201Ccurrent news\u201D and \u201C\
      unpaid bills.\u201D\n\n\u2018If he needs private briefings, we can accommodate\u2019\
      \n\nDeripaska is a longtime ally of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir\
      \ Putin. Manafort\u2019s relationship with Deripaska, meanwhile, stretches back\
      \ years and relates to the two men\u2019s work pushing pro-Russian interests\
      \ on the world stage.\n\nDeripaska and Manafort worked together in 2006, when\
      \ Deripaska signed a $US10 million annual contract with Manafort for a lobbying\
      \ project in the US that Manafort said would \u201Cgreatly benefit the Putin\
      \ Government.\u201D\n\nBut things haven\u2019t always been rosy between them.\
      \ Deripaska\u2019s representatives claimed, in legal complaints filed in the\
      \ Cayman Islands in 2014, that Manafort had disappeared after Deripaska gave\
      \ him and his longtime associate Rick Gates $US19 million to invest in a failed\
      \ Ukrainian TV venture in 2007.\n\nLast year, The Washington Post reported that\
      \ Manafort emailed Kilimnik, beginning in April 2016, offering to give Deripaska\
      \ \u201Cprivate briefings\u201D about the Trump campaign. Former intelligence\
      \ officials told Business Insider that the offer was likely part of Manafort\u2019\
      s effort to resolve his financial dispute with Deripaska.\n\n\u201CI assume\
      \ you have shown our friends my media coverage, right?\u201D Manafort reportedly\
      \ wrote to Kilimnik on April 11, 2016.\n\n\u201CAbsolutely,\u201D replied Kilimnik.\
      \ \u201CEvery article.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow do we use to get whole,\u201D Manafort\
      \ responded. \u201CHas OVD operation seen?\u201D\n\nInvestigators concluded\
      \ that \u201COVD\u201D was a reference to Deripaska\u2019s full name: Oleg Vladimirovich\
      \ Deripaska.\n\nKilimnik reportedly told Manafort in a later email that he had\
      \ been \u201Csending everything to Victor, who has been forwarding the coverage\
      \ directly to OVD.\u201D Victor was a senior aide to Deripaska, according to\
      \ The Atlantic.\n\n\u201CFrankly, the coverage has been much better than Trump\u2019\
      s,\u201D Kilimnik wrote. \u201CIn any case it will hugely enhance your reputation\
      \ no matter what happens.\u201D\n\nOn July 7, 2016, Manafort wrote to Kilimnik,\
      \ \u201CIf he needs private briefings, we can accommodate,\u201D according to\
      \ The Post.\n\nDeripaska\u2019s representatives confirmed to Vice News that\
      \ his jet flew to New Jersey in August 2016, but said the trip had nothing to\
      \ do with Manafort\u2019s offer and said Deripaska never received the offer.\
      \ A spokesperson for Deripaska added that the only passengers on the flight\
      \ at the time were the oligarch\u2019s family members, and added that any implication\
      \ that Deripaska communicated with Manafort during the election \u201Cwould\
      \ be a false statement of fact.\u201D\n\nMueller\u2019s office has charged Manafort\
      \ with dozens of counts related to tax and bank fraud, money laundering, and\
      \ conspiracy against the US. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\

    text: The hot reality is that global warming is real, and that it has already
      begun to affect the climate. Over the last four winters, the expanse of Arctic
      sea ice has been the lowest on record, which has endangered native settlements
      that rely on an iced-up coast to keep winter storms from eroding land. Rising
      seas and related erosion also have forced the relocation of a village in the
      Louisiana bayou, and low-lying cities are trying to figure out how to cope with
      coastal flooding. As many as 20 million Americans could become climate refugees
      by the end of the decade, according to a study published in the Proceedings
      of the National Academy of Science. Climate scientists warn that droughts and
      flooding will worsen and that hurricanes likely will become bigger, stronger
      and more frequent. But that is all mythology to the likes of Pruitt.

      \ combined all these nefarious qualities.\n\nAmerica\u2019s great good fortune\
      \ was to begin with the opposite \u2013 a superb moral leader. By June of 1775,\
      \ when congress appointed George Washington to command the nation\u2019s army,\
      \ he had already \u201Cbecome a moral rallying post,\u201D as his biographer,\
      \ Douglas Southall Freeman, described him. He was,\u201Cthe embodiment of the\
      \ purpose, the patience, and the determination necessary for the triumph of\
      \ the revolutionary cause.\u201D\n\nWashington won the war and then led the\
      \ fledgling nation \u201Cby directness, by deference, and by manifest dedication\
      \ to duty.\u201D\n\nA president\u2019s most fundamental legal and moral responsibility\
      \ is to uphold and protect our system of government. Donald Trump has degraded\
      \ that system.\n\nWhen he threatens to loosen federal libel laws so he can sue\
      \ news organizations that are critical of him and revoke licenses of networks\
      \ critical of him, he isn\u2019t just bullying the media. He\u2019s threatening\
      \ the constitutionally guaranteed freedom and integrity of the press.\n\nWhen\
      \ he equated Neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members with counter-demonstrators in\
      \ Charlottesville, Virginia, by blaming \u201Cboth sides\u201D for the violence,\
      \ he wasn\u2019t being neutral. He was condoning white supremacists, thereby\
      \ undermining the constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal rights.\n\nWhen he\
      \ pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, for a\
      \ criminal contempt conviction, he wasn\u2019t just signaling it\u2019s okay\
      \ for the police to engage in violations of civil rights. He was also subverting\
      \ the rule of law by impairing the judiciary\u2019s power to force public officials\
      \ to abide by court decisions.\n\nWhen he criticized NFL players for kneeling\
      \ during the national anthem, he wasn\u2019t just demanding they demonstrate\
      \ their patriotism. He was disrespecting their \u2013 and, indirectly, everyone\u2019\
      s \u2013 freedom of speech.\n\nWhen he berates the intelligence agencies and\
      \ the federal bureau of investigation, he isn\u2019t just questioning their\
      \ competence. He\u2019s suggesting they\u2019re engaged in a giant conspiracy\
      \ to remove him from office \u2013 potentially inviting his most ardent supporters\
      \ to engage in a new civil war.\n\nWhen he boasts that he made up information\
      \ in a meeting with the prime minister of Canada, he isn\u2019t just undermining\
      \ his own credibility. He\u2019s undermining the credibility of the united states\
      \ in the eyes of the world.\n\nDonald Trump is degrading the core institutions\
      \ and values of our democracy.\n\nBut America is fighting back.\n\nIn Alabama,\
      \ voters turned out in droves to elect a Democrat to the senate for the first\
      \ time in 25 years. In Pennsylvania, Republicans lost control of a congressional\
      \ district that went for Trump by nearly 20 percentage points. Since Trump took\
      \ office, Democrats have flipped 39 Republican-held state legislative seats.\n\
      \nThe 2018 midterm elections are approaching. It\u2019s up to all of us to keep\
      \ up the momentum. In the face of the worst president in history, we are at\
      \ our best when striving to strengthen our democracy."

      \ is racist, dishonest and \u201Cmentally unfit\u201D for office, according\
      \ to a new survey that finds the nation\u2019s youngest potential voters are\
      \ more concerned about the Republican\u2019s performance in the White House\
      \ than older Americans.\n\nThe poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for\
      \ Public Affairs Research and MTV found that just 33 percent of Americans between\
      \ the ages of 15 and 34 approve of Trump\u2019s job performance.\n\nThat\u2019\
      s 9 points lower than all adults, who were asked the same question on a separate\
      \ AP-NORC survey taken this month.\n\n\u201CTrump doesn\u2019t care about us,\u201D\
      \ said 27-year-old Nicole Martin, an African-American graduate student in Missoula,\
      \ Montana. \u201CI\u2019m not going to say he\u2019s unfit like he has schizophrenia.\
      \ I do kind of think he\u2019s twisted in the head. He just comes off as disgusting\
      \ to me.\u201D\n\nThe survey is the first in a series of polls designed to highlight\
      \ the voices of the youngest generation of voters. The respondents, all of whom\
      \ will be old enough to vote when Trump seeks re-election in 2020, represent\
      \ the most diverse generation in American history.\n\nThey would occupy the\
      \ largest share of the electorate \u2014 if they vote at the same rate as older\
      \ Americans. But history suggests they are also the least likely to vote this\
      \ fall. In the 2014 midterm elections, for example, only about 20 percent of\
      \ 18-29 year-olds cast ballots.\n\nAsked if she will vote this fall, when the\
      \ president\u2019s party, but not the president himself, will be on the ballot,\
      \ Martin said: \u201CI haven\u2019t really thought about it.\u201D\n\nStill,\
      \ there are signs that seven months before the midterm elections, young people\
      \ appear to be more engaged in politics. Nearly half of younger Americans, 47\
      \ percent, say they\u2019re personally paying closer attention to politics since\
      \ Trump\u2019s election; 2 in 10 say they\u2019re engaging in political activism\
      \ more than before.\n\nHigh school students led massive protests nationwide\
      \ last weekend that called for gun control in the wake of the recent school\
      \ shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead, and the poll found that\
      \ young people are more focused about guns than any other issue. Twenty-one\
      \ percent say the nation\u2019s gun laws are their top concern, while 15 percent\
      \ cited the economy and 8 percent said social inequality.\n\nThere is widespread\
      \ agreement among young people about Trump, with more than 7 in 10 saying he\
      \ \u201Cdoesn\u2019t reflect my personal values.\u201D\n\n\u201CHe doesn\u2019\

      \ country. \u201CHe doesn\u2019t seem to be for the kids worried about guns.\
      \ It\u2019s extremely disappointing to have a president who doesn\u2019t seem\
      \ to care.\u201D\n\nThe new poll finds that 60 percent describe Trump as \u201C\
      mentally unfit,\u201D 62 percent call him \u201Cgenerally dishonest,\u201D and\
      \ 63 percent say he \u201Cis a racist.\u201D In a mid-February AP-NORC poll,\
      \ 57 percent of all adults in the U.S. said they believe Trump is racist.\n\n\
      Spencer Buettgenbach, 23, of Topeka, Kansas, said the Republican president has\
      \ emboldened attitudes about racism, sexism and homophobia by \u201Cnormalizing\
      \ abusive talk.\u201D\n\n\u201CEspecially living in Kansas \u2014 for me as\
      \ a gay man \u2014 it\u2019s kind of scary,\u201D he said. \u201CHe\u2019s like\
      \ the world\u2019s worst boogeyman.\u201D\n\nThe poll also found that young\
      \ people overwhelmingly support watching out for minorities: 69 percent favor\
      \ a pathway to legal status for immigrants brought to the country illegally\
      \ as children, 59 percent favor protecting the rights of LGBT citizens, and\
      \ 58 percent say the same for Muslims.\n\nAmong other issues young voters feel\

      \ to address climate change.\n\nA narrow majority, 55 percent, favor legalizing\
      \ the recreational use of marijuana. Just under half, 46 percent, believe abortion\
      \ should be legal \u201Cin most cases,\u201D with 26 percent opposed.\n\nTrump\u2019\
      s domestic priorities are far less popular among young people. Only 22 percent\

      \ than half oppose construction of a wall along the Mexican border to curb illegal\
      \ immigration. Thirty-six percent want to increase defense and military spending,\
      \ though just 27 percent say they\u2019re opposed.\n\nKristopher Cochran, 22,\
      \ a conservative who voted for Trump, said he\u2019s \u201Cneutral\u201D about\
      \ the president\u2019s job performance so far. He suggested Trump is being treated\
      \ unfairly by the media \u2014 an opinion shared by 54 percent of young Americans.\n\
      \nCochran, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Tech, dismissed concerns\
      \ about Trump\u2019s mental fitness.\n\n\u201CIf he was mentally unfit, I don\u2019\
      t think he would have made as much money as he did, but I can see why people\
      \ would think that,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m not a fan of his incessant\
      \ need for Twitter. He acts like a child.\u201D\n\nCochran is not alone in his\

    text: "The joint military service chiefs were not briefed on the recommendations\
      \ by Defense Secretary James Mattis against the transgender military ban or\
      \ the Trump memo seeking to implement them before the White House went public\
      \ with them last Friday, according to two sources familiar with the process.\n\
      \nOne source said the top uniformed officials at the Pentagon had to download\
      \ the documents online just like the rest of the public late on March 23 to\
      \ obtain them for the first time.\n\nMaj. Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokesperson,\
      \ wouldn\u2019t deny the joint chiefs weren\u2019t briefed on the recommendation\
      \ before it went public, but said their representatives were on the panel of\
      \ experts that advised Mattis on transgender service before he made his recommendation.\n\
      \n\u201CRecommendations and conversations between the secretary and the president\
      \ are private, however, each service was represented on the panel of experts,\u201D\
      \ Gleason said.\n\nGleason said the group of experts on which Mattis relied\
      \ before making his recommendation on February 22 to the White House was \u201C\
      a panel of service and joint staff senior leaders.\u201D\n\nA defense official\
      \ said the service chiefs may not have had the documents in hand before they\
      \ went public Friday, but that wasn\u2019t unusual because it was a part of\
      \ a process in which Mattis was tasked with producing a recommendation and there\
      \ was no actual policy before the White House issued its memo March 23.\n\n\
      There\u2019s a history of Trump not consulting the joint chiefs on his plan\
      \ to ban transgender people \u201Cin any capacity\u201D from the armed forces,\
      \ which he announced via Twitter in July. A Buzzfeed report last month on an\
      \ email exchange immediately after Trump tweeted out his announcement revealed\
      \ Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford called the move \u201C\
      unexpected\u201D and intended to tell Congress he was \u201Cnot consulted.\u201D\
      \n\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment\
      \ late Friday on why the administration elected not to brief the service chiefs\
      \ before making the transgender policy public.\n\nEven after the White House\
      \ made the transgender policy public last week, the Pentagon has insisted it\
      \ will continue to assess and retain transgender troops in accordance with multiple\
      \ court orders against Trump\u2019s earlier policy that found banning transgender\
      \ service members is unconstitutional."

    text: "Last fall, a group of Democratic state attorneys general and immigration\
      \ lawyers sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president\u2019s decision\
      \ to scrap the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) was unlawful,\
      \ in part because it was motivated by Donald Trump\u2019s alleged bigotry toward\
      \ communities of color.\n\nThe Justice Department tried to get the case dismissed.\
      \ A New York judge yesterday rejected that effort, citing the president\u2019\
      s \u201Cracially charged language.\u201D The New York Times reported:\n\n[I]n\
      \ his order rejecting the motion to dismiss, [Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of\
      \ Federal District Court in Brooklyn] pointed directly at Mr. Trump, noting\
      \ that his numerous \u201Cracial slurs\u201D and \u201Cepithets\u201D \u2013\
      \ both as a candidate and from the White House \u2013 had created a \u201Cplausible\
      \ inference\u201D that the decision to end DACA violated the equal protection\
      \ clause of the Constitution. \u201COne might reasonably infer,\u201D Judge\
      \ Garaufis wrote, \u201Cthat a candidate who makes overtly bigoted statements\
      \ on the campaign trail might be more likely to engage in similarly bigoted\
      \ action in office.\u201D\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a ruling on the merits of the\
      \ case \u2013 the argument against the White House\u2019s policy is still being\
      \ litigated \u2013 but it was a procedural victory for those trying to protect\
      \ Dreamers from Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it was the latest\
      \ evidence that the president is often his own worst enemy. Because if this\
      \ dynamic sounds familiar \u2013 a court using Trump\u2019s own words against\
      \ him \u2013 it\u2019s because it keeps happening.\n\n* In January, the administration\
      \ lost a separate DACA case, and the court ruling cited the president\u2019\
      s own rhetoric when ruling against his position.\n\n* In Bowe Bergdahl\u2019\
      s case, the judge indicated that he would consider Donald Trump\u2019s record\
      \ of highly provocative rhetoric towards Bergdahl as part of the sentencing\
      \ decision.\n\n* The initial versions of the White House\u2019s Muslim ban faced\
      \ repeated legal difficulties because of Trump\u2019s own rhetoric.\n\n* The\
      \ D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded over the summer that Democratic attorneys\
      \ general could participate in a case over health care policy as a result of\
      \ Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n* And the administration\u2019s lawyers ran into\
      \ the same problem last April trying to defend Trump\u2019s executive order\
      \ on so-called \u201Csanctuary cities.\u201D\n\nIn a way, Trump\u2019s opponents\
      \ should probably hope he never stops speaking his mind so freely."

      \ security detail breaking down the door of the townhouse, convinced that Pruitt\

      \ Pruitt waking up from a nap.\n\nThe event reportedly occurred on March 29,\

      \ no response to their frantic knocking on the door. Pruitt\u2019s security\

      \ for the title of Most Corrupt Member of the Administration, a distinction\
      \ that presumably comes with a senior role at the Trump Organization once this\
      \ whole house of cards comes tumbling down. And reader, the competition has\
      \ been fierce. Earlier this month, we learned that Treasury Secretary Steven\
      \ Mnuchin has spent nearly $1 million flying on either military or private planes\
      \ when commercial flights would have sufficed, choosing \u201Cthe most expensive\
      \ flight options available at every turn, appearing to never even consider flying\
      \ commercial as his predecessors did.\u201D Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who\
      \ runs his department like he\u2019s the Queen of England, has also acquired\
      \ a taste for luxe travel accommodations, blaming Barack Obama for his staff\u2019\
      s inability to produce documents justifying his decision to stay as far away\
      \ from coach as possible. Recently fired V.A. chief David Shulkin used a made-up\
      \ award to take his wife on a taxpayer-funded jaunt to Europe (but of course,\
      \ that\u2019s not the reason he was shown the door). First Son-in-Law Jared\
      \ Kushner has taken meetings with financial executives, and subsequently scored\
      \ half a billion dollars in loans for the family business, in which he retains\
      \ a financial stake. (Kushner has pushed back on the idea that the former influenced\
      \ the latter, as have both companies involved.) H.U.D. Secretary Ben Carson\
      \ is out there acquiring $31,000 dining sets for his office and using the old\
      \ \u201Cit was for safety reasons\u201D excuse. But this week, one Trump official\
      \ looked at his colleagues and clearly thought, child\u2019s play. Because while\
      \ Mnuchin and Zinke may be ringing up hundreds of thousands in airfare, and\
      \ Carson is invoicing taxpayers for his high-priced interior-design choices,\
      \ E.P.A. Administrator Scott Pruitt is shacking up with lobbyists in an arrangement\
      \ that doesn\u2019t look great!\n\nAfter learning on Thursday that Pruitt had\
      \ spent the better part of last year living in a top energy lobbyist\u2019s\
      \ townhouse, on Friday it emerged that he wasn\u2019t exactly paying market\
      \ rate to do so. According to Bloomberg, Pruitt\u2019s rent was just $50 a night,\
      \ but that he only paid for nights he stayed at the apartment, which is not\
      \ how most leases work. Considering that the E.P.A. chief frequently flies around\
      \ the country for work\u2014previously only in first class, because someone\
      \ was mean to him once\u2014it seems he scored a pretty sweet deal thanks to\
      \ the selfless generosity of J. Steven Hart, the chairman of a firm whose clients\
      \ include a bevy of energy companies, and his wife, Vicki Hart, a health-care\
      \ lobbyist. In total, Pruitt reportedly paid $6,100 over roughly six months,\
      \ in a neighborhood where other units have rented for $5,000 per month. Oh,\
      \ and apparently his daughter lived there while serving as a White House intern\
      \ in 2017, though the owners say they don\u2019t know anything about that.\n\
      \nIn a statement to the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general, Craig Holman, an ethics\
      \ specialist at nonpartisan watchdog Public Citizen, wrote: \u201CSince Administrator\
      \ Pruitt is already involved in allegations of accepting gifts of travel, the\
      \ question arises whether a sense of entitlement may have led him to violate\
      \ the gift rules on this rental arrangement as well.\u201D He noted that the\
      \ living situation would \u201Cat least constitute a violation of the federal\
      \ statutes and executive branch rules prohibiting gifts to covered officials\
      \ from prohibited sources.\u201D Pruitt, clearly, stopped giving a f--k about\
      \ conflicts of interest a long time ago, if he ever gave any in the first place.\n\
      \nBut in all of the drama of his housing deal, we should not lose sight of an\
      \ important point: Pruitt would likely be turning the E.P.A into a polluter\u2019\
      s paradise regardless of whether he was simultaneously saving thousands on rent.\
      \ In the past year, he\u2019s made it his job to dismantle every effort made\
      \ by the Obama administration to tackle climate change, including, as The New\
      \ York Times reported on Thursday, rolling back provisions requiring cars to\
      \ be cleaner and more fuel efficient. This, naturally, has delighted every industry\
      \ that stands to profit from his all-out assault on science and facts\u2014\
      that he\u2019s holed up in a sweet townhouse practically rent-free is just the\

      \ comment will earn you a warning or ban if you include a personal attack.\n\
      \nSubmission Rules\n\nThe /r/Politics On Topic Statement\n\nAll submissions\
      \ to /r/politics need to, at a minimum, include an internal discussion or focus\
      \ about current US politics. This means that if a subject has political implications\
      \ but does not directly discuss US politics, it is most likely off topic. Submissions\
      \ must be articles, videos, polls, or sound clips.\n\nTo be political, submissions\
      \ should have a focus on one of the following things that have political significance:\n\
      \nInformation and opinions concerning the running of US governments, courts,\
      \ public services and policy-making.\n\nPrivate political actions and stories\
      \ such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and political movements,\
      \ groups and donors.\n\nThis does not include:\n\nThe non-political actions\
      \ of otherwise political figures. (ex. Donald Trump wore a turquoise shirt instead\
      \ of a blue one)\n\nRelatives and associates that do not have political significance.\
      \ (ex. Diane Feinstein\u2019s Father, Predator, Attempts Murder of Arnold Schwarzenegger)\n\
      \nInternational politics unless that discussion focuses on the implications\
      \ for the U.S. (ex. How US-Chinese trade deal will affect the EU)\n\nDiscussion\
      \ of the media that does not have explicit political connotations (ex. CNN fires\
      \ Wolf Blitzer)\n\nDisallowed submission types:\n\n/r/Politics is a serious\
      \ political discussion forum. To facilitate that type of discussion, all submissions\
      \ must be articles, videos or sound clips. The following are also disallowed:\n\
      \nSatire or humor pieces. These belong in /r/PoliticalHumor.\n\nLinks that solicit\
      \ users (Active petitions, signature campaigns, requests for money, surveys\
      \ or polls).\n\nLinks to social media, such as Google+, Facebook or Twitter.\n\
      \nPersonal Blogs. All blogs submitted must be affiliated with a reputable news\
      \ source.\n\nPolitical advertisements as submissions. Advertisers should buy\
      \ ad space on reddit.com if they wish to advertise on Reddit.\n\nDomain whitelist\n\
      \nAll submissions to /r/politics must be from domains on the whitelist. Submissions\
      \ from domains not on the whitelist will be removed.\n\nArticles must be published\
      \ within the last calendar month.\n\nOld content is often misleading because\
      \ the political landscape changes rapidly. We therefore require all submissions\
      \ in /r/politics to be published within the last calendar month. For example,\
      \ if the date is January 29 and the article submitted was written before December\
      \ 29, then the submission is out of date.\n\nNo Paywalls Allowed\n\nArticles\
      \ that require users to take a survey, or to enter any information in order\
      \ to view material, or to become a paid subscriber are not allowed.\n\nDo not\
      \ create your own title\n\nSubmissions must have titles comprised of the exact\
      \ copied and pasted headline from the article. Do not add, remove or change\
      \ words - with the following required changes::\n\nDon't use the word \"BREAKING\"\
      \ or other time sensitive words in your submissions - you must remove it if\
      \ the original title contains it.\n\nHave commentary like \"watch now\" \"read\
      \ this\" etc. - you must remove it if the original title contains it.\n\nDon't\
      \ write titles in ALL CAPS - even if the original title is capitalized. If a\
      \ title contains one or more words in ALL CAPS, it will be removed. Exception:\
      \ Acronyms and initialisms may remain in ALL CAPS.\n\nNo Emojis, use text only.\
      \ Please remove any emojis from the title prior to submitting in accordance\
      \ with the above guidelines.\n\nIf the moderators remove for having a user-created\
      \ title, you are encouraged to resubmit with an appropriate title.\n\nThe most\
      \ objective way for the moderation team to avoid inserting political bias into\
      \ how submissions are handled is not to give exceptions and make judgement calls\
      \ on whether slight changes are \"okay\" or not. We therefore enforce the title\
      \ rules consistently even if that means removing articles for minor title changes.\n\
      \nWe are aware that websites update their articles and change their titles.\
      \ The mods will try to keep that in mind when examining articles, but these\
      \ changes can be hard to follow. If a post is removed where the title was appropriate\
      \ earlier, please message the moderators.\n\nEnsure that you are using the original\
      \ source\n\nThose who create content we share on the site deserve the credit\
      \ for the content they have created. It is therefore essential that we remove\
      \ any content that is posted from sources that are not the owners and creators\
      \ of content.\n\nPlease refrain from posting:\n\nvideos from news networks rehosted\
      \ on youtube or similar sites\n\narticles comprised of content from other sources\
      \ without original analysis or reporting\n\nblogs and webpages rehashing content\
      \ found elsewhere\n\narticles that rely on chunks of text from external sources\
      \ to make an argument.\n\nAny content posted with a shortened link or via a\
      \ redirect.\n\nBecause the whole of Reddit relies on content produced by others,\
      \ we have to protect the interests of content-creators or the quality of free\
      \ content that we can share will drop.\n\nSpam is Bad!\n\nWe will ban spammers\
      \ in /r/politics. We ban for both comment and submission spam. As a rule of\
      \ thumb, if you have more than 33% of submissions from a single domain (excluding\
      \ Imgur), we will ban you from /r/politics and ask for you to diversify your\
      \ submissions before returning.\n\nIf you are banned for spam and you didn't\
      \ realize that you had crossed the line, then please diversify your submissions\
      \ and message the mods to appeal your ban. We will take diversified posts to\
      \ outside subreddits into consideration during your appeals process.\n\nDisclosure\
      \ of employment.\n\nr/politics expressly forbids users who are employed by a\
      \ source to post link submissions to that source without broadcasting their\
      \ affiliation with the source in question. Employees of any r/politics sources\
      \ should only participate in our sub under their organization name, or via flair\
      \ identifying them as such which can be provided on request. Users who are discovered\
      \ to be employed by an organization with a conflict of interest without self\
      \ identifying will be banned from r/politics. Systematic violations of this\
      \ policy may result in a domain ban for those who do not broadcast their affiliation.\n\
      \nDo not flood the new queue.\n\nPlease make sure that you allow at least 10\
      \ minutes to pass between each submission, and submit no more than 5 articles\
      \ within a 24 hour period. This is so that other Redditors have the opportunity\
      \ to submit content and have it visible to /r/politics users. Deleted posts\
      \ are included in this rule. Moderator removed posts are not. Queue flooding\
      \ will result in moderator action against offending accounts.\n\nDo not resubmit\
      \ \"Already Submitted\" Content.\n\nIn order to ensure that a large variety\
      \ of articles have the opportunity to be seen in /r/Politics, we have strict\
      \ rules on what constitutes acceptable reposting.\n\nA piece of content may\
      \ be re-submitted if all of the following are apply:\n\nAll earlier duplicates\
      \ are at least three days old All earlier duplicates have a low vote score There\
      \ are no more than two earlier duplicates\n\nIn other words, a piece of content\
      \ may have up to three attempts to achieve a threshold vote score, and these\
      \ attempts must be spaced at least three days apart.\n\n(note that if a submission\
      \ is removed due to breaking another rule, it does not count as an \"earlier\
      \ duplicate\" for the purposes of the reposting policy.)\n\nAll submissions\
      \ must be in English.\n\nAll submissions must be primarily written in the English\
      \ language.\n\nAMA-Specific Rules\n\nIn order to make sure that AMAs are enjoyable\
      \ events for all involved, AMA threads are more strictly moderated. The following\
      \ additional policies apply to AMA threads:\n\nTop level comments should be\
      \ a question or statement for the AMA host to respond to. \"Meta\" discussion\
      \ about /r/politics or moderation policies is not allowed. Memes, jokes, and\
      \ low-effort replies to the AMA host are not allowed Requests for personal favors\
      \ from the AMA host (ex. \"Can you send me an autograph?\") are not allowed.\
      \ Creepy/offensive comments with no possibility of a real answer from the AMA\
      \ host are not allowed. \"I bet OP won't answer this\" type questions are not\
      \ allowed. Repeating the same question multiple times is not allowed - this\
      \ will be treated as comment spam.\n\nAdditionally, incivility towards the AMA\
      \ host will not be tolerated. Although we normally permit incivility towards\
      \ politicians, AMA hosts within their AMA thread will be considered \"redditors\"\
      \ rather than politicians, and accordingly will receive benefits from the comment\
      \ civility rules.\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nPlease send a PM to the /r/politics modteam if\
      \ you have any questions or concerns.\n\nPlease do not message individual moderators\
      \ directly with questions about /r/politics.\n\nWhy can't I see my post / Why\
      \ was my post removed?\n\nplease check near the title to see if the mods have\
      \ tagged it with the sidebar rule it has violated.\n\nIf your post isn't showing\
      \ up in the new queue and it is not tagged then it has probably accidentally\
      \ fallen into the spam filter. Message the mods with a link to the comments\
      \ section of your post and we will investigate.\n\nSome domains are filtered\
      \ because they are spam or other types of inappropriate content. In addition\
      \ to reddit-wide domain bans, /r/politics also has banned several domains for\
      \ spamming, vote brigading, rehosting content, or other types of inappropriate\
      \ content.\n\nWhy do I see content that break the rules on the front page?\n\
      \nAs moderators we strive to ensure that all posts that violate our rules are\
      \ removed because this is the most fair and consistent way to conduct the business\
      \ of moderation on this subreddit. The issue is, there are a lot less of us\
      \ than there are of you. We get a lot of mod mail (which we don't mind) as well\
      \ as spam submissions (which we do mind), and that takes up a lot of our volunteered\
      \ time. We rely on the community to report posts or comments that violate rules\
      \ to the moderators. If you see rulebreaking content, please send us a message.\n\

      \ The chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin is up in arms about plans by\
      \ Scott Walker, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican governor, to change a law so that\
      \ Republicans can avoid losing another special election. \u201CHe has already\
      \ rigged the system so much that he thought he would not have to worry any more,\u201D\
      \ says Ms Laning, referring to districts gerrymandered to favour Republicans,\
      \ which voters are challenging at the Supreme Court (see article), and voter-identification\
      \ laws that make it harder for minorities and poor people to vote.\n\nUntil\
      \ a few months ago Mr Walker expected to cruise to re-election in November for\
      \ a rare third term. Yet the year started with a shock for him. In January a\
      \ historically Republican district in a rural western region in Wisconsin voted\
      \ for Patty Schachtner, a Democrat, in a special election for a state Senate\
      \ seat, even though her Republican opponent, Adam Jarchow, was far more experienced\
      \ and better funded.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get\
      \ our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid\
      \ another nasty surprise in a special election, Mr Walker decided not to hold\
      \ any. Yet on March 22nd Josann Reynolds, a county-circuit judge appointed by\
      \ the governor, ruled that by March 29th he must call special elections for\
      \ a vacant seat in the state Assembly and one in the state Senate. Not holding\
      \ them, she argued, would disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters who have\
      \ not been represented since December, when two Republicans resigned to work\
      \ for the governor. Mr Walker reacted by asking Republican legislative leaders\
      \ to recall lawmakers for an extraordinary session on April 4th, so they could\
      \ pass a bill that would no longer allow special elections after the state\u2019\
      s spring election in even-numbered years. (This year\u2019s spring election\
      \ is on April 3rd).\n\nThe Republican Party has majorities of 18 to 14 in the\
      \ state Senate and 63 to 35 in the Assembly, so neither race risks changing\
      \ the balance of power. Yet Mr Walker does not want to give Democrats more of\
      \ the momentum that helped them flip seats in three dozen elections for state\
      \ legislatures since Donald Trump was elected president. A poll earlier this\
      \ month by the law school of Marquette University in Milwaukee found the state\
      \ evenly divided: 47% of those surveyed approved of the job the governor is\
      \ doing, while 47% disapproved.\n\nTwo other Republican governors, Rick Snyder\
      \ of Michigan and Rick Scott of Florida, are stalling on special elections.\
      \ Mr Snyder has decided to wait until November to replace John Conyers, a Democratic\
      \ congressman who resigned in December because of allegations of sexual harassment,\
      \ as well as Bert Johnson, a Democratic state senator who resigned after pleading\
      \ guilty to charges of corruption. Mr Scott, who like Mr Snyder is term-limited,\
      \ is refusing to hold special elections for two seats in Florida\u2019s legislature.\n\
      \nA couple of Wisconsin\u2019s Republican state senators have expressed concerns\
      \ about Mr Walker\u2019s proposed opt-out from special elections. The bill will\
      \ not pass if they vote against it. The governor may still be obliged, after\
      \ all, to abide by Judge Reynolds\u2019s ruling."

      The travel ban put forward by President Donald Trump at the beginning of last\
      \ year via executive order led to 1,903 people being stopped by customs agents.\n\
      \nThe majority of them were legal residents of the US.\n\nWhile that travel\
      \ ban was blocked by a judge in February 2017, Trump later issued two other\
      \ travel bans, the second of which has been allowed to go forward by the Supreme\
      \ Court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban caused 1,903 people to\
      \ be stopped during the nine days it was enforced in early 2017, according to\
      \ a newly public document, BuzzFeed reported.\n\nThe document, which was released\
      \ under a Freedom of Information Act request, shows that the majority of the\
      \ people stopped, 1,457 of them, were legal permanent residents of the US. Of\
      \ those who were not permanent residents, 134 withdrew their entry request,\
      \ which means they likely had to leave the country. Another 446 people were\
      \ reportedly sent to secondary inspection.\n\nTrump abruptly put the travel\
      \ ban into place via an executive order in January 2017 soon after he took office,\
      \ and it suspended the visas of people from seven Muslim-majority countries\
      \ in the Middle East and Africa. The ban was halted by a judge in early February,\
      \ placing a temporary restraining order on its enforcement nationwide.\n\nWhile\
      \ the Department of Homeland Security had initially stated that legal permanent\
      \ residents were not included as part of the travel ban, the White House overruled\
      \ the department and said it would review their entry on a case-by-case basis.\n\
      \nIn addition to individuals being stopped at airports and border crossings,\
      \ 10 people were reportedly detained aboard a boat in American waters.\n\nTrump\
      \ has tried several times to reframe the ban, but was met with legal challenges\
      \ each time. A second, narrower travel ban was also blocked last year, but a\
      \ third travel ban, issued in September, was allowed to move forward by the\
      \ Supreme Court. But even this travel ban is still under legal consideration,\
      \ and the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on it this month, according\
      \ to BuzzFeed.\n\nSeveral federal courts have declared this third travel ban\
      \ unconstitutional, and a federal appeals court joined the chorus of opposition\
      \ in February.\n\nNOW WATCH: Briefing videos\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\

      \ supporters of a tougher gang law in the state talked a lot about the need\

      \ learned that everyone arrested under the existing gang law from 2010 through\
      \ 2017 were African American.\n\nOver the last year, members of the Mississippi\
      \ Association of Gang Investigators worked to spread the message that not all\
      \ gang members in Mississippi are African American, Hispanic or another ethnicity.\
      \ In fact, they warned, many of the state's toughest gang members are now white,\
      \ between the growing Simon City Royals, white supremacist groups like the Aryan\

      \ groups in the state, are white. It is a potentially surprising statistic in\
      \ the state with the highest proportion of African Americans in the nation and\
      \ that experiences a large amount of media coverage of its black and Hispanic\
      \ gangs.\n\nThe Mississippi State Gang Assessment, published in December 2017,\
      \ listed the white Simon City Royals as the third largest criminal street gang\
      \ in the state behind the Black Gangster Disciples and the Vice Lords, both\
      \ black gangs. In addition, MAGI members regularly provide examples of heinous\
      \ crimes by white gang members, such as the murder and dismemberment of a Royals\
      \ snitch on the Coast in 2016. Welford Lee McCarty is now serving a life sentence\
      \ for murder charges.\n\nMAGI's recent message was clear: The state's gang investigators\
      \ are not fixated on black gangs and do not want the expanded gang law in order\
      \ to profile young people of color. When asked to comment on the 53-percent-white\
      \ report, Pascagoula District Attorney Tony Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press\
      \ via email: \"I have not seen that statistic and cannot comment on it, but\
      \ I can say, in remembering gang cases in my office, I have prosecuted more\
      \ white gang members for crimes than of any other race.\"\n\nProsecuting someone\
      \ for a specific crime who happens to be a gang member and prosecuting someone,\
      \ or adding on additional sentences, for being a member of a gang are two completely\
      \ different things, however.\n\nIt is not talked about a lot in the push for\
      \ an expanded gang law, but Mississippi already has a gang law on the books.\
      \ The Mississippi Streetgang Act, passed in 2001, targets \"three (3) or more\
      \ persons with an established hierarchy that, through its membership or through\
      \ the agency of any member, engages in felonious criminal activity.\" That is,\
      \ much like the FBI does with the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt\
      \ Organizations Act, called RICO, the State can go after a group that conspires\
      \ together to commit a criminal act. That is different from making it illegal\
      \ to be part of a gang and thus being held responsible for crimes other members\
      \ might commit separately, as the failed gang law this session could have done.\n\
      \nBut despite MAGI frequently warning that white gang members pose a strong\
      \ threat in today's Mississippi, the arrests and prosecutions under the existing\
      \ street-gang law have only targeted African Americans, State Public Defender\
      \ Andre de Gruy pointed out to the Jackson Free Press after the expanded gang\
      \ law failed this session.\n\nThe JFP's 'Preventing Violence' Series A full\

      \nThe Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed that from fiscal-year 2010\
      \ through 2017, court disposition data show that 97 people were processed under\
      \ current gang law. All of them were black.\n\nOf those 97, 22 pled guilty,\
      \ four were dismissed, one faced house arrest, 11 were no-billed (dismissed),\
      \ one was non-adjudicated, 36 passed to the file, 17 remanded to the file and\
      \ five had probation revoked, the Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed.\n\
      \n\"From 2010 to 14 it was seldom used\u2014fewer than 30 dispositions,\" de\
      \ Gruy explained in an email. \"The last two years of data indicate 32 indictments\
      \ disposed of per year. These came from 5 of 22 districts but primarily from\
      \ Forrest and DeSoto counties.\"\n\nThe State's 2017 gang-threat assessment\
      \ found that 413 Simon City Royals had been in custody in DeSoto County last\
      \ year, but that does not mean they were prosecuted under existing gang law.\
      \ The assessment also pointed out that a Forrest County gang member, part of\
      \ the 74 Hoover Crip Gang, was arrested in 2015 for capital murder and other\
      \ felonies for killing two police officers. The Forrest County Corner said he\
      \ died later that year in jail from heart disease. (Note: The assessment was\
      \ found during the 2018 legislative session to have dramatically over-counted\
      \ the number of gang members in Mississippi prisons.)\n\nDe Gruy, who opposed\
      \ the expanded law due to both costs and the potential to profile people of\
      \ color, says more information is needed to fully vet who the current gang law\
      \ is already targeting. He would like more information about the dispositions\
      \ under the existing law, including who was under 18 at the time of charge.\n\
      \nHe also suggested that gang laws could use a way to check them for racial\
      \ profiling. \"[A] provision could be crafted to review the racial impact annually,\"\
      \ de Gruy said.\n\nOn the Senate floor, the sponsor of this session's expanded\
      \ gang bill, Senate Bill 2868, deflected concerns that expanded gang laws are\
      \ used to profile Mississippians of color. \"\"It's not a Republican, Democrat(ic),\

      \ over a week after the Chinese Commerce ministry had announced it was considering\
      \ tariffs on the goods. Just over a week later, those tariffs are taking effect.\n\
      \nThe move is expected to lead to escalating tensions between the two large\
      \ trading nations, leading many to worry that American farmers will be casualties\
      \ in a tit-for-tat trade war.\n\nThe U.S. shipped more than $1 billion of pork\
      \ products to China last year, making it the No. 3 destination for exports after\

      \nWhile the Trump administration has said the steel and aluminum tariffs are\
      \ necessary to protect national security, Beijing rejected that argument in\
      \ its statement and said they ran afoul of WTO rules.\n\nChina's responses,\
      \ meanwhile, are \"legitimate measures ... to use the rules of the World Trade\
      \ Organization and safeguard its interests,\" the statement said.\n\nMore tariffs\
      \ between the two countries are possible in the near future. In March, Trump\

      \ Islands before last year\u2019s inauguration.\n\nSpecial Counsel Mueller has\
      \ a cooperating witness who says that Trump\u2019s mercenary puppet master Erik\

      \ backed psychological warfare company Cambridge Analytica.\n\nNow, details\
      \ of Dmitriev\u2019s close links to Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin show that\
      \ the relationship isn\u2019t just business, but personal. In fact, Kirill Dimitriev\
      \ got the job as CEO of Russia Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) because his wife\
      \ befriended Putin\u2019s daughter, with whom they remain close to this day.\
      \ Very close, according to the Times:\n\nAccording to six people close to Mr\
      \ Dmitriev, his wife is close friends with Mr Putin\u2019s younger daughter.\
      \ Mr Dmitriev\u2019s wife Natalia Popova was in the same year at Moscow State\

      \ is the deputy director of her technology foundation, Innopraktika. Ms Popova\u2019\
      s close friendship with Ms Tikhonova helped secure Mr Dmitriev\u2019s job running\
      \ the Kremlin\u2019s $10bn Russia Direct investment Fund and has made him a\
      \ powerful figure in the Kremlin, according to three people who work with Mr\

      \ knows him socially.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding Congress take action\
      \ on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!\n\nIn fact, Dmitriev\
      \ is so close to Putin that he is still on the board of his daughter\u2019s\
      \ firm Innopraktica today. More importantly, he\u2019s a minor oligarch in his\
      \ own right, after a stint on the board of Sibur, a major Russian refinery and\
      \ chemicals company which he owns 3.9% of today (down from 21.4% when he sold\
      \ shares last year) in which Putin\u2019s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, is a\
      \ senior executive.\n\nBack when Dmitriev owned that huge block of Sibur shares,\
      \ the RDIF \u2013 which he has run since its inception in 2011 \u2013 approved\
      \ a $1.75 billion dollar loan to the company. (Yes, that is a very apparently\
      \ conflicted and corrupt use of government funds to benefit Putin\u2019s insider\
      \ family and friends).\n\nOne of the Times\u2018 sources must be pretty close\
      \ to the Russian banker because he or she has a granular view of his daily routine.\n\
      \nMr Dmitriev regularly attends Ms Tikhonova\u2019s performances in acrobatic\
      \ rock and roll dancing alongside Mr Shamalov, according to the parent of another\
      \ contestant.\n\nPutin\u2019s daughter, Ms. Tikhonova happens to be the world\u2019\
      s foremost Acrobatic Rock N\u2019 Roll dancers (watch her here) which has led\
      \ the Russian state run by her dad to invest over $30 million of state funds\
      \ into building the world\u2019s only dedicated facility for the niche sport.\n\
      \nWhy would Erik Prince, the outed CIA agent, and brother of Trump\u2019s most\
      \ despised cabinet member, Betsy DeVos, best known as the infamous founder of\
      \ the murderous mercenary firm Blackwater, want to meet with a Russian banker\
      \ halfway around the world?\n\nErik Prince told the House Intel Committee that\
      \ he only had a routine meeting at a hotel bar with RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev\
      \ by accident late last November.\n\nBut Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s cooperating\
      \ witness George Nader \u2013 the pedophile advisor close to both the UAE rulers\
      \ and Donald Trump \u2013 says that Prince went to the Seychelles Islands specifically\
      \ to form a communications backchannel with Russia, so urgent that it couldn\u2019\
      t wait for the inauguration just weeks later.\n\nPresumably, only one of the\

      \ previously worked for the Trump White House and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\

      \ week featured former Trump White House official Sebastian Gorka. (During a\
      \ panel on Sinclair-owned WJLA in October, Gorka lamented \u201Cblack Africans\u201D\

      \ was Kristine Frazao, who before working for Sinclair was a reporter and anchor\

      \ too far too fast for fear of backlash, but make no mistake that these are\

      \ and local stations would come up with create ways around it, including by\
      \ airing the segments in the wee hours of the mornings. Sinclair has gotten\
      \ wise to that and is demanding prime newstime spots. The intrusions will become\
      \ ever more propagandistic and severe as time goes on.\n\nWhat\u2019s all the\
      \ more galling about this is the decades-long conservative complaint about a\
      \ liberal media cabal, when back on planet Earth the only media cabals are explicitly\
      \ conservative. Fox News exists as a fact-free conservative talking point organ,\
      \ and sits much further to the right than MSNBC does to the left (let me know\
      \ when Fox News devotes three hours of daytime programming to a Democratic Congressmember\
      \ turned insufferable talking head.) The New York Times and Washington Post\
      \ opinion sections are far more equitably balanced ideologically than the Wall\

      \ even approaching a left-leaning equivalent of the numerous explicitly right-wing\
      \ tabloid and conservative publications like National Enquirer and Washington\
      \ Times. Clear Channel Communications have gone out of their way to suffocate\
      \ progressive voices while elevating an army of Rush Limbaughs, Laura Ingrahams\
      \ and all of their clones. The farthest left station you can find outside of\
      \ a few large urban enclaves is NPR and, well, NPR stations don\u2019t actually\
      \ devote much airtime devote to actual politics, the content is painfully he-said\
      \ she-said, and if you value progressive viewpoints you should probably tune\
      \ out when Marketplace comes on.\n\nThe real threats to consolidated control\
      \ of the media come from the right, not from the left.\n\nConservatives have\
      \ always painted themselves as the poor benighted victims of the very same tactics\
      \ they use most often. Media control is no different.\n\nPreserving democracy\

      \ Affairs Secretary David Shulkin speaks at a news conference in Washington.\
      \ Andrew Harnik/The Associated Press\n\nFormer Veterans Affairs Secretary David\
      \ Shulkin is making it clear he was fired from his job amid conflicting claims\
      \ from the White House.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters on Sunday\
      \ told The Associated Press that Shulkin had \u201Cresigned\u201D from his job\
      \ when President Donald Trump abruptly announced via Twitter last Wednesday\
      \ that he was nominating White House doctor Ronny Jackson to replace him.\n\n\
      But in television interviews, Shulkin said he had not submitted a resignation\
      \ letter, or planned to, and was only told of Trump\u2019s decision shortly\
      \ before the Twitter announcement. He said he had spoken to Trump by phone earlier\
      \ that day about VA improvements, with no mention of his job status, and was\
      \ scheduled to meet with the president the next morning.\n\nStory continues\
      \ below advertisement\n\n\u201CI came to run the Department of Veterans Affairs\
      \ because I\u2019m committed to veterans,\u201D Shulkin said. \u201CAnd I would\
      \ not resign, because I\u2019m committed to making sure this job was seen through\
      \ to the very end.\u201D\n\nThe semantics could be relevant to Trump\u2019s\
      \ ability to name an acting VA secretary to temporarily fill Shulkin\u2019s\
      \ place. Last week, Trump named Defence Department official Robert Wilkie to\
      \ the acting position, bypassing Shulkin\u2019s deputy secretary, Tom Bowman.\
      \ Bowman has come under criticism for being too moderate to push Trump\u2019\
      s agenda.\n\nUnder federal law, a president has wide authority to temporarily\
      \ fill a federal agency job if someone \u201Cdies, resigns, or is otherwise\
      \ unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.\u201D There is no\
      \ mention of a president having that authority if the person is fired. Still,\
      \ it\u2019s unclear if courts would seek to draw a legal distinction between\
      \ a firing and a forced resignation, if that is indeed what happened to Shulkin.\n\
      \nThe day after announcing that he was replacing Shulkin, Trump told a rally\
      \ in Richfield, Ohio, that he had been dissatisfied with efforts to improve\
      \ VA. Shulkin had enjoyed Trump\u2019s support for much of his first year in\
      \ the administration, but that eroded in February after a bruising ethics scandal\
      \ and political infighting at VA.\n\nA VA spokesman did not have immediate comment\
      \ Sunday. Wilkie, now listed on the VA website as acting secretary, took over\
      \ Shulkin\u2019s duties last week.\n\nThe back and forth over the circumstances\
      \ behind Shulkin\u2019s departure \u2013 and what it could mean for Wilkie\u2019\
      s status \u2013 comes as the nomination of Jackson is drawing concern among\
      \ lawmakers and veterans groups. They worry the Navy rear admiral and lifelong\
      \ physician lacks the experience to manage an enormous agency paralyzed over\
      \ Trump\u2019s push to expand private care.\n\nTrump\u2019s new Cabinet nominees\
      \ also are beginning to pile up in the Senate, likely leading to weeks of confirmation\
      \ battles and other delays in the run-up to congressional midterm elections\
      \ in November. That could mean an extended reign for an acting VA secretary.\n\
      \nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\
      \nOn Sunday, Shulkin, who had previously recommended Jackson to be VA undersecretary\
      \ of health, repeatedly demurred when asked to fully endorse Jackson for the\
      \ job of VA secretary. He noted the complexity of running the government\u2019\
      s second largest department.\n\n\u201CThis is a very tough job,\u201D Shulkin\
      \ said. \u201CI\u2019m not sure that anybody realizes how complex this is ...\
      \ I think he is going to need to have a good team around him, like everybody\
      \ will, to be successful.\u201D\n\nShulkin\u2019s dismissal comes amid a broader\
      \ shakeup of top Trump administration officials and charges of excessive spending\
      \ by Cabinet officials. Also currently under fire are Environmental Protection\
      \ Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Housing\
      \ and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.\n\nThe AP reported last week that\
      \ Pruitt paid just $50 a night for about six months last year to stay in a Capitol\
      \ Hill condominium linked to a prominent Washington lobbyist whose firm represents\
      \ fossil fuel companies.\n\nOn Sunday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie,\
      \ a Republican, and Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., questioned whether Pruitt would\
      \ be able to last in his job.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know how you survive this\
      \ one, and if he has to go, it\u2019s because he never should\u2019ve been there\
      \ in the first place,\u201D Christie said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\

    text: 'For the first time, according to party officials, Democrats will have a
      candidate challenging Republicans for every El Paso County office up for election
      in November.


      After Saturday''s county assembly in Colorado Springs, El Paso County Democratic
      Party Chairwoman Electra Johnson said there will be three June 26 primary races.
      Two Democrats each are vying for clerk and recorder and in House districts 15
      and 18, she said.


      Democrats will also be in the races for county commissioner districts 1 and
      5, sheriff, assessor, coroner, surveyor and treasurer.


      "There''s no better way to send a message to El Paso County that the blue wave
      is coming than to have Democrats listed on these ballot lines," Johnson said.
      "This is what democracy looks like."


      Despite optimism among Democrats nationwide that opposition to President Donald
      Trump and his policies will enable them to pick up seats in the U.S. House and
      Senate in the 2018 midterms, Democrats running for El Paso County offices will
      be heavy underdogs.


      El Paso County is the state''s largest Republican stronghold. This year, 41
      percent of registered voters in the county are Republicans to 21 percent Democrats.


      Often, the Republican nominee or primary election victor is unopposed in November,
      but, this year, for example, the winner of the Republican primary for sheriff
      will face a Democrat in November.


      Grace Sweeney-Maurer was nominated as a sheriff''s candidate from the floor.
      Sweeney-Maurer''s law enforcement experience is as a facilitator of a police
      training academy course in Hawaii.


      "We need to start having Democrats represented in offices across the county,"
      she said.


      Matt Reid, a deputy El Paso County coroner, is running for coroner; Elizabeth
      Wilkes and Jonathan Herrera were nominated to run for clerk and recorder; Julie
      Torres is running for treasurer; Sue McKnight is running for assessor; and Destarte
      Haun is running for surveyor.


      Kari Frederick is running for District 5 county commissioner, and Frank DeLalla
      will run for District 1.


      Pete Lee, the Colorado House District 18 representative, will run for state
      Senate District 11 against Republican Patrick McIntire.

      to Kessler, Conway said some of the most "mean, cutting and honestly untrue"
      things about former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and also "dissed" Ivanka
      Trump and Jared Kushner, the President''s senior advisor and son-in-law.

    text: "So now that he has assembled what some are calling his war cabinet, will\
      \ President Trump actually start a war?\n\nThat has been the subject of a lot\
      \ of worried conversation inside Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment\
      \ since Trump appointed John Bolton \u2014 known for his frequent advocacy of\
      \ preemptive bombing \u2014 as his national security adviser. Bolton and Secretary\
      \ of State-designate Mike Pompeo agree with Trump that the nuclear deal with\
      \ Iran was a disaster, and they have both suggested that regime change is the\
      \ only solution to the standoff with North Korea. The question is, is Trump\
      \ himself really capable of initiating war with one of those countries? With\
      \ both?\n\nA good case can be made that he isn\u2019t. Though he extended U.S.\
      \ military action in Syria and Iraq during his first year in office, Trump has\
      \ been a loud skeptic of American military ventures. He now is vowing to pull\
      \ out of Syria, and he had to be talked out of pulling the plug on Afghanistan.\
      \ What\u2019s more, any move by Trump to launch an unprovoked attack on either\
      \ Iran or North Korea will run into a wall of opposition from U.S. allies, Congress,\
      \ Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Pentagon brass, and, most likely, Trump\u2019\
      s own political base, which has grown used to cheering his rhetoric about wasteful\
      \ wars.\n\nWar would also be a break from the emerging diplomatic model of this\
      \ president, which is to bluster and bluff, then cut a deal. That\u2019s what\
      \ happened last week with South Korea, which saw the free-trade agreement Trump\
      \ called \u201Chorrible\u201D not torn up but slightly amended. Trump has been\
      \ trying to do the same with the Iran pact, denouncing it while his diplomats\
      \ quietly pressure European governments to agree to fixes \u2014 a process that,\
      \ at least until the ouster of Rex Tillerson from the State Department, looked\
      \ as though it might succeed.\n\nThe main danger, then, is not that Trump will\
      \ choose war. It is that he will stumble into it, through impulsive acts unattached\
      \ to any coherent strategy. He has set up two big, high-risk decision points\
      \ for this spring: on whether to renew sanctions on Iran in mid-May and whether\
      \ to deal with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un at a summit by the end of that\
      \ month. If he accepts a face-saving bargain on Iran with the Europeans, or\
      \ a promise by Kim to denuclearize, he will contradict everything that the notoriously\
      \ inflexible Bolton has stood for over decades \u2014 raising the question of\
      \ why Trump hired him.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Trump takes the counsel his\
      \ new aide has already offered on television and scraps the Iran accord while\
      \ stiffing or rebuking Kim, he will create two crises \u2014 and hand the initiative\
      \ in both to America\u2019s enemies.\n\nIran\u2019s clerical regime will be\
      \ particularly pleased. The nuclear accord has been a big disappointment in\
      \ Tehran: The investment it was supposed to trigger from Western companies has\
      \ mostly failed to arrive, and a stagnating economy is fueling popular unrest.\
      \ Trump could give President Hassan Rouhani a chance to split the United States\
      \ from Europe by demanding new concessions from the latter in exchange for sticking\
      \ to the deal. Or the Revolutionary Guard Corps could use the militias it controls\
      \ in Iraq and Syria to bleed U.S. forces with ambushes and roadside bombs, as\
      \ it did a decade ago. Or, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could roll\
      \ the dice and resume uranium enrichment, betting that Trump won\u2019t have\
      \ the nerve or the political support to stop it with military action.\n\nIt\u2019\
      s pretty evident that Trump hasn\u2019t thought much about what happens after\
      \ he tears up the deal \u2014 he\u2019s simply fixated on undoing the legacy\
      \ of Barack Obama. He doesn\u2019t have a strategy for containing an aggressive\
      \ Iranian response. But Bolton, the ruling princes of Saudi Arabia and the United\
      \ Arab Emirates, and perhaps Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu will push the\
      \ White House for military action. Trump may find himself cornered.\n\nSomething\
      \ similar could happen in North Korea. If Trump fails to satisfy Kim\u2019s\
      \ demands for concessions, the predictable result is a resumption of the regime\u2019\
      s tests of intercontinental missiles and nuclear warheads. Then what? Trump\
      \ doesn\u2019t have a plan, but Bolton has already announced his \u2014 a unilateral\
      \ U.S. strike, followed by the occupation of North Korea by U.S. troops.\n\n\
      Trump may manage to avoid these crises while still achieving his underlying\
      \ aim of monopolizing the world\u2019s attention. He could accept Europe\u2019\
      s offer on Iran, or give the deal another extension to leave time for more negotiations.\
      \ He could announce a grand-sounding but vague accord with Kim, delegating the\
      \ substance to years of tedious but time-buying negotiations.\n\nThat\u2019\
      s exactly the sort of temporizing that Bolton has described as worse than going\
      \ to war. But he may learn, as numerous Trump aides already have, that Trump\
      \ is in charge of this reality show.\n\nRead more from Jackson Diehl\u2019s\

    text: "Liberal candidate Rebecca Dallet has won election to the Wisconsin Supreme\
      \ Court, according to Decision Desk. Dallet defeated her conservative opponent\
      \ for the open seat, Michael Screnock easily, and her victory will cut the conservative\
      \ majority on the court from 5-2 to just 4-3.\n\nDallet\u2019s win is yet another\
      \ example of liberal voter enthusiasm in state and local elections held during\
      \ the age of Trump. And in Wisconsin specifically, it\u2019s a rare victory\
      \ for a Democratic Party that\u2019s been beaten again and again in recent years.\
      \ (The race was technically nonpartisan, but Dallet was the Democrat-backed\
      \ candidate, and Screnock the conservative-backed one.)\n\nHowever, the court\
      \ will remain in conservative hands for the near future. The next conservative-held\
      \ seat won\u2019t be up for election until 2020, and before that, liberals will\
      \ have to defend one of their own seats next year.\n\nOnce elected, Wisconsin\
      \ Supreme Court justices serve out 10-year terms. However, if a seat should\
      \ become vacant in the middle of a term, the governor can appoint a replacement\
      \ justice. A new election is then scheduled for that seat in the first year\
      \ when there\u2019s no other supreme court election on the ballot (that is,\
      \ two seats can\u2019t go up for election in the same year). Tuesday\u2019s\
      \ election is for an open seat held by a conservative justice who chose to retire.\n\
      \nBut though these court elections are \u201Cnonpartisan,\u201D in practice\
      \ the state supreme court has become bitterly divided along ideological lines,\
      \ with millions of dollars in outside spending pouring into these contests \u2014\
      \ and conservatives usually tending to come out on top.\n\nAfter many Wisconsin\
      \ defeats, liberals hope they are finally turning things around\n\nConservatives\
      \ have held a majority on the seven-member Wisconsin Supreme Court since 2008.\
      \ This proved crucial when Gov. Scott Walker (R) was sworn in in 2011, and plunged\
      \ the state into an enormously bitter controversy by signing a law gutting collective\
      \ bargaining rights for public employees. Liberals saw opportunity to strike\
      \ back just a few months later, when a conservative supreme court justice faced\
      \ reelection \u2014 ideological and interest groups on both sides poured money\
      \ into the race, making it a high-stakes showdown.\n\nAs has so often happened\
      \ during the Walker years, though, liberals came up short in that 2011 contest\
      \ \u2014 the conservative justice won reelection by a mere 0.4 percent margin.\
      \ Walker himself then beat back a recall attempt in 2012, and saw the court\
      \ uphold his collective bargaining law in 2014, before winning a full second\
      \ term that fall.\n\nShortly afterward, conservatives expanded their supreme\
      \ court majority to 5-2 when Walker appointed Rebecca Bradley to an open seat.\
      \ She won reelection to a full term in 2016. Then, in 2017, when conservative\
      \ justice Annette Ziegler was up, liberals were still dazed from Donald Trump\u2019\
      s shocking victory in the state and didn\u2019t even bother to put up a candidate\
      \ \u2014 Ziegler won a second ten-year term unopposed.\n\nBut this time around,\
      \ when conservative justice Michael Gableman decided not to run for another\
      \ term, Wisconsin liberals didn\u2019t let the opportunity slip by. Dallet \u2014\
      \ a judge for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, and a former assistant district\
      \ attorney and adjunct law professor \u2014 ran for the open seat, and won.\n\
      \nAnd that\u2019s not Democrats\u2019 only recent Wisconsin victory. This January,\
      \ the party picked up a state senate seat in a district Trump won by 17 points,\
      \ and overperformed (but lost) in a state assembly special election in a very\
      \ conservative area. Walker responded with alarm, tweeting that the results\
      \ should be \u201Ca wake up call for Republicans.\u201D The governor then absurdly\
      \ tried to not hold more special elections this year \u2014 clearly afraid of\
      \ losing \u2014 until court rulings forced him to abandon that effort.\n\nThere\u2019\
      s a high-stakes US Senate contest in Wisconsin this fall\n\nDemocrats don\u2019\
      t really have any top-tier US House targets in Wisconsin this fall \u2014 Speaker\
      \ Paul Ryan is being challenged by viral fundraiser Randy \u201CIronstache\u201D\
      \ Bryce, and Rep. Glenn Grothman (R) is on some target lists, but they\u2019\
      re both considered reaches for the party.\n\nAs for the governorship, where\
      \ Walker is running for a third term, the Democratic field is currently inchoate\
      \ \u2014 no candidate polled higher than 18 percent in a recent Marquette primary\
      \ poll. (The August 14 primary is still a few months off.)\n\nSo the marquee\
      \ Wisconsin contest in the 2018 midterms is instead the Senate race, in which\
      \ Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) is running for a second term. State senator Leah Vukmir\
      \ and Marine veteran Kevin Nicholson are squaring off in a tense primary contest\
      \ for the Republican nomination. (Nicholson recently drew some national attention\
      \ because his parents donated thousands of dollars to Baldwin.)\n\nBaldwin is\
      \ a staunch progressive representing a state Trump (narrowly) won, and conservative\
      \ groups are desperate to defeat her, spending far disproportionately on the\
      \ race compared to other 2018 contests. If Baldwin should lose, that would make\
      \ it incredibly difficult for Democrats to retake the Senate, along with replacing\
      \ a leading liberal with a solid conservative. But Dallet\u2019s victory, and\
      \ Democrats\u2019 general overperformance in Trump era state elections, gives\
      \ the party hope that Baldwin will survive."

      s attorneys last month that he is continuing to investigate the president but\
      \ does not consider him a criminal target at this point, according to three\
      \ people familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn private negotiations in early\
      \ March about a possible presidential interview, Mueller described Trump as\
      \ a subject of his investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016\
      \ election. Prosecutors view someone as a subject when that person has engaged\
      \ in conduct that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence\
      \ to bring charges.\n\nThe special counsel also told Trump\u2019s lawyers that\
      \ he is preparing a report about the president\u2019s actions while in office\
      \ and potential obstruction of justice, according to two people with knowledge\
      \ of the conversations.\n\nMueller reiterated the need to interview Trump \u2014\
      \ both to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russia\
      \ investigation and to complete this portion of his probe, the people said.\n\
      \nMueller\u2019s description of the president\u2019s status has sparked friction\
      \ within Trump\u2019s inner circle as his advisers have debated his legal standing.\
      \ The president and some of his allies seized on the special counsel\u2019s\
      \ words as an assurance that Trump\u2019s risk of criminal jeopardy is low.\
      \ Other advisers, however, noted that subjects of investigations can easily\
      \ become indicted targets \u2014 and expressed concern that the special prosecutor\
      \ was baiting Trump into an interview that could put the president in legal\
      \ peril.\n\nJohn Dowd, Trump\u2019s top attorney dealing with the Mueller probe,\
      \ resigned last month amid disputes about strategy and frustration that the\
      \ president ignored his advice to refuse the special counsel\u2019s request\
      \ for an interview, according to a Trump friend.\n\nTrump\u2019s chief counsel,\
      \ Jay Sekulow, and Dowd declined to comment for this report. White House press\
      \ secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred questions to White House attorney\
      \ Ty Cobb.\n\n\u201CThank you, but I don\u2019t discuss communications with\
      \ the president or with the Office of Special Counsel,\u201D Cobb said Tuesday.\n\
      \nPeter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, declined to\
      \ comment.\n\nThe wide-ranging special counsel investigation, which began as\
      \ an examination of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, has expanded\
      \ into other areas, including whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe.\n\n\
      [Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice,\
      \ officials say]\n\nMueller\u2019s investigators have indicated to the president\u2019\
      s legal team that they are considering writing reports on their findings in\
      \ stages \u2014 with the first report focused on the obstruction issue, according\
      \ to two people briefed on the discussions.\n\nUnder special counsel regulations,\
      \ Mueller is required to report his conclusions confidentially to Deputy Attorney\
      \ General Rod J. Rosenstein, who has the authority to decide whether to release\
      \ the information publicly.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019ve said they want to write a\
      \ report on this \u2014 to answer the public\u2019s questions \u2014 and they\
      \ need the president\u2019s interview as the last step,\u201D one person familiar\
      \ with the discussions said of Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys\
      \ expect the president would also face questions about what he knew about any\
      \ contacts by his associates with Russian officials and emissaries in 2016,\
      \ several White House advisers said. The president\u2019s allies believe a second\
      \ report detailing the special counsel\u2019s findings on Russia\u2019s interference\
      \ would be issued later.\n\nThe president has privately expressed relief at\
      \ the description of his legal status, which has increased his determination\
      \ to agree to a special counsel interview, the people said. He has repeatedly\
      \ told allies that he is not a target of the probe and believes an interview\
      \ will help him put the matter behind him, friends said.\n\nHowever, legal experts\
      \ said Mueller\u2019s description of Trump as a subject of a grand jury probe\
      \ does not mean he is in the clear.\n\nUnder Justice Department guidelines,\
      \ a subject of an investigation is a person whose conduct falls within the scope\
      \ of a grand jury\u2019s investigation. A target is a person for which there\
      \ is substantial evidence linking him or her to a crime.\n\nA subject could\
      \ become a target with his or her own testimony, legal experts warn.\n\n\u201C\
      If I were the president, I would be very reluctant to think I\u2019m off the\
      \ hook,\u201D said Keith Whittington, a professor of politics at Princeton University\
      \ and impeachment expert.\n\n\u201CMy sense of it is the president \u2014 given\
      \ that information \u2014 ought to have pretty fair warning anything he\u2019\
      s saying in the deposition would be legally consequential. Depending on what\
      \ he says, it could wind up changing how the special counsel is thinking about\
      \ him.\u201D\n\nStill, several legal scholars and impeachment experts believe\
      \ Mueller may conclude he does not have the authority to charge a sitting president\
      \ with a crime under an opinion written by the Justice Department\u2019s Office\
      \ of Legal Counsel in 1973 and reaffirmed in 2000.\n\nIf Mueller finds Trump\
      \ engaged in criminal conduct, he could detail it in a report, experts argue,\
      \ and let Congress to decide whether to launch impeachment proceedings based\
      \ on Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201CThe president\u2019s personal risk is\
      \ primarily on the impeachment front,\u201D Whittington said. \u201CEven if\
      \ there are not things that lead to indictment, there may be matters that warrant\
      \ an impeachment investigation and proceedings.\u201D\n\nSome of Trump\u2019\
      s advisers have warned White House aides that they fear Mueller could issue\
      \ a blistering report about the president\u2019s actions.\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019\
      s public actions have called into question whether he sought to blunt or block\
      \ the criminal probe, a line of inquiry that prosecutors began pursuing last\
      \ year. He has repeatedly called the investigation a \u201Cwitch hunt\u201D\
      \ that has unfairly sullied his administration and hampered his ability to accomplish\
      \ his policy agenda. He fired FBI Director James B. Comey in May after Comey\
      \ told Congress that the bureau was investigating possible coordination between\
      \ the Trump campaign and the Russians. Trump was furious that Comey did not\
      \ state that he was not personally under investigation, The Washington Post\
      \ previously reported.\n\nThe president also asked top intelligence officials\
      \ to issue public statements denying the existence of any evidence of coordination\
      \ between his campaign and the Russian government.\n\n[Trump asked intelligence\
      \ chiefs to push back against FBI collusion probe after Comey revealed its existence]\n\
      \nMueller\u2019s team has told Trump\u2019s attorneys over recent months that\
      \ they are seeking to learn more about the firings of Comey and national security\
      \ adviser Michael Flynn last year and the president\u2019s efforts to get Attorney\
      \ General Jeff Sessions to resign.\n\nNevertheless, Trump has repeatedly expressed\
      \ an eagerness to sit down for a voluntary interview to answer Mueller\u2019\
      s questions \u2014 a move Dowd believed would be a mistake, according to a longtime\
      \ Trump friend.\n\nDowd told the president the case against him was weak, but\
      \ warned Trump he could create criminal jeopardy for himself if he agreed to\
      \ an interview and misspoke under oath, the friend said. Dowd repeatedly pointed\
      \ to the Trump campaign advisers who have pleaded guilty to making false statements\
      \ in the Mueller probe \u2014 including Flynn, adviser George Papadopoulos and\
      \ former campaign official Rick Gates.\n\n\u201CMueller hasn\u2019t hesitated\
      \ to [charge] people for lying on some pretty tangential stuff,\u201D said Solomon\
      \ Wisenberg, a former deputy independent counsel in the probe of President Bill\
      \ Clinton.\n\nHowever, Sekulow and Cobb gave the president the opposite advice\
      \ as Dowd: that it would be politically difficult for Trump to refuse to answer\
      \ questions after insisting for months there was no collusion or crime, according\
      \ to three people familiar with their advice.\n\nWisenberg, who interviewed\
      \ Clinton about allegations that he obstructed justice, said Trump has handled\
      \ himself well in previous depositions but should be cautious.\n\n\u201CI think\
      \ he would do much better than people think,\u201D Wisenberg said. \u201CBut\
      \ there are plenty of instances where a guy walks into a grand jury a subject.\

    text: '(CNN) A political appointee at the Department of Defense has resigned after
      a CNN KFile inquiry about controversial postings he made on Facebook.


      Todd Johnson is a former Trump campaign state director in New Mexico who joined
      the Department of Defense in 2017 as an advance officer, a Pentagon employee
      with the sensitive task of providing logistical support related to the secretary''s
      events and appearances domestically and abroad. Johnson had a pay scale of GS-14,
      typically reserved for senior civil service positions.


      A CNN KFile review of his social media found that Johnson posted birther conspiracies
      about then-President Barack Obama and shared a video that claimed Obama was
      the Antichrist.


      After CNN initially reached out to the Pentagon for comment, Johnson made his
      Facebook account private. A spokesperson confirmed Johnson was still working
      at the Pentagon Tuesday morning, but in the afternoon, after CNN informed the
      Department of Defense that a story was forthcoming, a Pentagon spokesperson
      said Johnson had offered his resignation and that it was accepted.


      Photos and videos posted online show Johnson has traveled extensively with Secretary
      of Defense Jim Mattis overseas and posed in photos with Trump and at the Pentagon
      along with Mattis and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel

      \ Parenthood chief says Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were, during Donald Trump\u2019\
      s 2016 transition as president-elect, so eager to be recognized as shrewd political\
      \ dealmakers that the soon-to-be first daughter and her husband made an offer\
      \ that felt like a \u201Cbribe\u201D: an increase in federal funding for Planned\
      \ Parenthood in exchange for its agreement to stop providing abortions.\n\n\
      Richards, in Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage\
      \ to Lead, out Tuesday, says she was leery of taking the meeting in January\
      \ 2017, but, after the defeat of Planned Parenthood\u2019s champion, Hillary\
      \ Clinton, she was open to finding possible new allies in the president-elect\u2019\
      s more moderate-leaning daughter and son-in-law.\n\nThe organization, after\
      \ all, was a favorite target of Trump and the GOP. Shortly after the election,\
      \ Speaker of the House Paul Ryan announced his intentions to defund Planned\
      \ Parenthood and get rid of Obamacare. While he hasn\u2019t succeeded, Planned\
      \ Parenthood and its services continues to be a lightning rod for the right.\n\
      \nCecile Richards Jared Siskin/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\n\u201CEveryone at Planned\
      \ Parenthood was hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,\u201D Richards,\
      \ 60, writes about Ryan\u2019s announcement. \u201CWe brainstormed, planned,\
      \ and made lists of anyone who might be a potential ally in the administration.\u201D\
      \n\nRichards \u2014 who is the daughter of feminist icon Ann Richards and passionately\
      \ campaigned for Hillary Clinton \u2014 was urged by a \u201Cfriendly acquaintance\
      \ in the fashion industry\u201D to reach out to President Trump\u2019s daughter\
      \ Ivanka for a meeting.\n\n\u201CEven if there was only a sliver of a chance\
      \ of changing anyone\u2019s mind, I owed it to Planned Parenthood patients to\
      \ at least take the meeting,\u201D Richards explains.\n\nWhile she was confident\
      \ about her talking points, she writes that she \u201Cbegged\u201D her husband,\
      \ Kirk Adams, to join her after she learned that Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband,\
      \ Jared Kushner, would also be in attendance.\n\n\u201CIf nothing else, I felt\
      \ I needed a witness,\u201D she writes.\n\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump SHAWN\
      \ THEW/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nOnce in the clubhouse, the couples chatted about\
      \ their families before getting down to business. According to a statement from\
      \ Planned Parenthood given to Time.com, the purpose of the meeting \u201Cwas\
      \ to make sure that Ivanka Trump fully understood the important role Planned\
      \ Parenthood plays in providing health care to millions of people and why it\
      \ would be a disastrous idea to block people from accessing care at Planned\
      \ Parenthood.\u201D\n\nAfter Richards explained this, she writes that Kushner\
      \ told her Planned Parenthood \u201Chad made a big mistake by becoming \u2018\
      political.\u2019 \u201D\n\n\u201CThe main issue, he explained, was abortion,\u201D\
      \ Richards writes. \u201CIf Planned Parenthood wanted to keep our federal funding,\
      \ we would have to stop providing abortions. He described his ideal outcome:\
      \ a national headline reading \u2018Planned Parenthood Discontinues Abortion\
      \ Services.'\u201D\n\nAccording to Make Trouble, Kushner said that if Richards\
      \ agreed to the plan then funding could increase, but he urged them to \u201C\
      move fast.\u201D\n\n\u201CIf it wasn\u2019t crystal clear before, it was now.\
      \ Jared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win,\u201D\
      \ she writes. \u201CIn their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from\
      \ providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers.\
      \ It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women\u2019s rights\
      \ for more money. It takes a lot to get Kirk mad, but it looked like his head\
      \ was about to explode.\u201D\n\nRichards explained that there was \u201Cno\
      \ way\u201D Kushner\u2019s proposal would work and that they\u2019d continue\
      \ to fight for funding.\n\n\u201C\u2018Our mission is to care for women who\
      \ need us, and that means caring for all of their reproductive needs \u2014\
      \ including safe and legal abortion,'\u201D she recalls saying. The meeting\
      \ eventually ended. As they were leaving, she writes that Kushner \u201Creminded\
      \ us that things were moving \u2018really fast.\u2019 \u201D A deal had to be\
      \ made quickly.\n\nIvanka Trump Says NBC Neporter\u2019s Question About Father\u2019\
      s Accusers is \u2018Inappropriate\u2019\n\nLater, Richards filled in Planned\
      \ Parenthood\u2019s executive vice president Dawn Laguens.\n\n\u201CHonestly,\
      \ it felt almost like a bribe,\u201D Richards remembers telling her, \u201C\
      I know there are people who will disagree with me, and maybe I shouldn\u2019\
      t have just shut down the conversation, but I did what I thought was best.\u201D\
      \n\nSince the meeting, Richards and Ivanka Trump have clashed publicly \u2014\
      \ mainly because of Ivanka Trump\u2019s decision to remain silent about Republican\
      \ attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhile Ivanka Trump\u2019s team has\
      \ yet to respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for a comment, she did defend her\
      \ decision to remain quiet after a bill passed last year that permits states\
      \ to refuse funding to organizations that provide abortions.\n\n\u201CI would\
      \ say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,\u201D she told\
      \ Gayle King during an interview with CBS News, according to Time.com. \u201C\
      Where I disagree with my father, he knows it. And I express myself with total\
      \ candor.\u201D\n\nCecile Richards isn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201CAt the time,\
      \ [Ivanka] sounded like she was sympathetic, but I will tell you this White\
      \ House has been worse for women than any administration I\u2019ve seen in my\
      \ lifetime,\u201D Richards told PEOPLE in July 2017 about her meeting with Ivanka\
      \ Trump. \u201CIt\u2019s been very, very disappointing.\u201D\n\nMake Trouble\
      \ is out now."

      \ Nagle/Bloomberg News)\n\nStocks closed higher on Tuesday after the Standard\
      \ & Poor\u2019s 500-index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite\
      \ index each fell by about 2 percent on Monday. Since Dec. 22, those indexes\
      \ were down 2.9 percent, 2.6 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.\n\nWhy does\
      \ that date matter? Because it\u2019s the day that President Trump signed the\
      \ tax cut bill into law \u2014 a bill that, according to him, would supercharge\
      \ the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201CWe must cut our taxes, reduce economic burdens\
      \ and restore America\u2019s competitive edge,\u201D Trump said during a November\
      \ speech in Missouri. \u201CWe\u2019re going to do that, too, and it\u2019s\
      \ already happening. Look what\u2019s happening with our markets. People get\
      \ it.\u201D\n\nAt that point, the Dow Jones was up 21 percent over the course\
      \ of his presidency, and it would continue spiking upward for the next few weeks.\
      \ But Trump promised more.\n\n\u201CThese massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel,\u201D\
      \ he said, \u201Crocket fuel for the American economy.\u201D\n\nTrump\u2019\
      s favorite measure for the health of the economy over the course of 2017 was\
      \ those same markets, which seemed as though they were never again going to\
      \ go down. Until they did \u2014 about 40 days after that rocket-fuel bill was\
      \ signed into law. In early February, the markets sank, kicking off what has\
      \ been a prolonged stretch of volatility.\n\nBetween Trump\u2019s inauguration\
      \ and the signing of the tax cut bill, the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq had increased\
      \ by 19.9 percent, 15.4 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. After, through\
      \ the market\u2019s close on Monday, they had fallen by 1.9 percent, 2.2 percent\
      \ and 2.7 percent.\n\nThey went back up Tuesday but were still down since Dec.\
      \ 22. Between Sept. 11 and Dec. 22, the Dow, the S&P and Nasdaq rose 11 percent,\
      \ 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. During the same number of market days\
      \ after the bill was signed, they were all down.\n\nAt close of market on Monday,\
      \ each measure was off its 52-week high by at least 9 percent. Before the bill\u2019\
      s signing, none of those indexes had been down more than 3.7 percent off its\
      \ 52-week high.\n\nBetween the signing of the bill and Monday, the indexes had\
      \ been down on about 46 percent of market days.\n\nBetween Trump\u2019s inauguration\
      \ and the bill signing, the Dow had dropped on 41 percent of days, the S&P on\
      \ 43 percent and the Nasdaq on 38 percent.\n\nThe markets are not the economy,\
      \ despite Trump\u2019s insistence over the course of 2017 that they were an\
      \ effective metric to judge his presidency. But it\u2019s certainly the case\
      \ that the tax bill was meant to aid businesses specifically, with the administration\
      \ pledging that the cuts would lead to massive reinvestment in those businesses\
      \ and then to increased employment.\n\nOver the next month, stock prices did\
      \ soar to new heights. Then they plunged, recovered and plunged again. In some\
      \ ways, that bolsters Trump\u2019s point. If you pour rocket fuel on something\
      \ that is already on fire? Things do get a little volatile."

      \ Highlights\n\nOn why she wanted to write about fascism\n\nFascism A Warning\
      \ by Madeleine Albright and Bill Woodward Hardcover, 288 pages | purchase close\
      \ overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\
      \nPart of the reason for writing [the book] is to say that, in fact, this can\
      \ happen in countries that have democratic systems, that have a population that's\
      \ interested in what's going on, that is supportive. ... That's what's so worrisome,\
      \ is that fascism can come in a way that it is one step at a time, and in many\
      \ ways, goes unnoticed until it's too late.\n\nOn why parts of the world are\
      \ moving toward authoritarianism\n\nI think that a lot of it has to do with\
      \ the era that we're in, where there has been very rapid change in technology\
      \ and that has created a lot of joblessness in countries. There is a whole way\
      \ that technology and information is passed without making sure that it's really\
      \ true. There are those people who are angry because the status quo hasn't changed,\
      \ while the climate within a country has changed, and that the powers that be\
      \ in a democracy aren't responding quickly enough.\n\nSo it's kind of like as\
      \ though we were seeing the people are getting their information on 21st century\
      \ technology, but the governments are providing 19th century responses. And\
      \ so the institutions are not responding to the divisions and the problems that\
      \ people are having in these countries.\n\nAnd then the other part of this,\
      \ which I think is essential, is there is some leader at the top who takes advantage\
      \ of these divisions and, in fact, exacerbates them so that the societies are\
      \ more and more divided and wrangled and looking for scapegoats, which is where\
      \ the immigrants come in. But mostly, this is something that's created internally\
      \ by massive changes in society and some of them, due to technology.\n\nOn President\
      \ Trump's \"America First\" ideology and criticism of NATO\n\nI see it as the\
      \ most unbelievable step backwards, because I do believe that the United States\
      \ is stronger when we have friends and allies to deal with the various issues.\
      \ ... As a European who has spent her life in the United States, I see the Euro-Atlantic\
      \ alliance as one of the most important bulwarks of our society, so seeing this\
      \ go on, I find appalling. And what is the issue \u2014 again, it's this lack\
      \ of understanding of what this alliance is about. ...\n\nWhat Trump is doing\
      \ is making America seem like a victim. Everything is somebody else's fault:\
      \ Countries are taking advantage of us. The Mexicans are sending drug dealers.\
      \ Countries are not paying their dues. The trading system is unfair. And by\
      \ making Americans seem like victims all the time, it then is able to, again,\
      \ make the divisions stronger in terms of who is with us, who is not with us,\
      \ and it's totally anti-American foreign policy. And so I think it's very, very\
      \ worrisome in terms of this victimhood.\n\nI don't see America as a victim.\
      \ I see America as the most powerful country in the world that has a role to\
      \ play, standing up for democratic ideals and human rights across the board.\n\
      \nOn John Bolton's appointment as national security adviser\n\nMy concerns are\
      \ that he has been an outspoken person for the use of force, for the absence\
      \ of diplomacy, for tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, for thinking that force\
      \ is possible with North Korea. And frankly, part of the problem is ... that\
      \ [Trump] listens to the last person who has talked to him, and the national\
      \ security adviser is most often the last person, so I am concerned about that.\n\
      \nOn her belief that President Trump is \"anti-democratic\"\n\nWhat he's trying\
      \ to do is undermine the press and [he] has disdain for the judiciary, and the\
      \ electoral process and minorities, and I think that his instincts are not ones\
      \ that are democratic. He is interested, basically, I think, in exacerbating\
      \ those divisions that I talked about. ... I've picked up that phrase \"see\
      \ something, say something,\" and I am seeing some things that are the kinds\
      \ of things that we have seen in other countries, and so I am saying not only\
      \ should we say something, but we have to do something about it. ...\n\nI think\
      \ people may disagree with the president of the opposing party ... but we normally\
      \ have believed that the president tells the truth. And I know I'm very worried\
      \ about the fact that there are deliberate ways of misstating the issue, and\
      \ then the people think, \"If the president said it, it must be right,\" when\
      \ it's just a deliberate untruth.\n\nSam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and\

      \ as they watch returns on election night at Good City Brewing in Milwaukee\
      \ on Tuesday, April 3, 2018. Dallet defeated conservative Sauk County Circuit\
      \ Judge Michael Screnock. (Rick Wood/AP)\n\nWisconsin Democrats declared victory\
      \ on Tuesday night after Milwaukee Judge Rebecca Dallet won a bitter race for\
      \ a seat on the state\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nDallet\u2019s win over Judge\
      \ Michael Screnock shrunk the conservative majority on the court to one vote,\
      \ after a campaign that had become the latest test of Trump-era liberal activism\
      \ and political spending.\n\nBoth candidates and their supporters turned the\
      \ race, which is technically nonpartisan, into a political referendum. Dallet\
      \ ran early ads that accused President Trump of \u201Cattack[ing] our civil\
      \ rights and our values,\u201D while Screnock portrayed himself as a \u201C\
      rule of law\u201D conservative endorsed by the National Rifle Association. By\
      \ election day, more than $2.5 million had been spent on TV ads.\n\nWith 88\
      \ percent of the precincts reporting, Dallet had 56 percent of the vote and\
      \ Screnock had 44 percent.\n\nVoters also defeated a ballot measure that would\
      \ have abolished the state treasurer\u2019s office, and which was backed by\
      \ Gov. Scott Walker (R).\n\nDemocrats, who had surprised Republicans in January\
      \ by flipping a state Senate seat in rural northwest Wisconsin, quickly turned\
      \ to the Supreme Court race. Screnock won 46.3 percent of the vote in a Feb.\
      \ 20 \u201Cjungle primary,\u201D with the rest of the vote going to Dallet and\
      \ another Democrat.\n\n[Democrats flip state senate seat in Wisconsin]\n\nThe\
      \ Democrat quickly worked to define Screnock, who had been appointed to the\
      \ bench by Walker, as an ideological extremist who had been arrested when protesting\
      \ abortion clinics.\n\n\u201CHe has advocated on behalf of gerrymandering, rigging\
      \ our maps in our state, which has been found to be unconstitutional,\u201D\
      \ said Dallet in a March debate with Screnock. \u201CHe has stood in front of\
      \ women\u2019s ability to access their lawful rights, and he\u2019s been arrested\
      \ twice for doing that.\u201D\n\nScrenock, who acknowledged his past as a protester,\
      \ said Dallet was the real activist in the race and he could be an honest broker.\n\
      \n\u201CEverything changed when I became a judge,\u201D he said. \u201CI am\
      \ no longer an advocate for any party that comes in front of me. I am no longer\
      \ an advocate for any issue that comes in front of me.\u201D\n\nScrenock\u2019\
      s defeat narrowed the court\u2019s conservative majority to 4-3, and Democrats\
      \ had not won an open Supreme Court seat election since 1995. They had been\
      \ burned by a close-call defeat in 2011, when what appeared to be an election-night\
      \ victory was undone by uncounted ballots from conservative Waukesha County.\n\
      \nBut the Democrats began Tuesday cautiously optimistic about a win. Turnout,\
      \ which had often been sluggish in the Democratic bases of Madison and Milwaukee,\
      \ was well ahead of previous years.\n\n\u201CTonight\u2019s results show we\
      \ are at risk of a #BlueWave in WI,\u201D Walker tweeted Tuesday night. \u201C\
      The Far Left is driven by anger & hatred \u2014 we must counter it with optimism\
      \ & organization. Let\u2019s share our positive story with voters & win in November.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CDemocrats have traditionally lost competitive races in the spring\
      \ because their voters didn\u2019t turn out,\u201D said Scot Ross, executive\
      \ director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. \u201CBut there\u2019\
      s been a year and a half of activism, getting people organized and excited before\
      \ this race.\u201D\n\nMultiple Democratic groups tried to direct that activism\
      \ into Tuesday\u2019s race. Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen America ran a millennial\
      \ turnout campaign; former vice president Joe Biden recorded a pro-Dallet call;\
      \ and former attorney general Eric Holder\u2019s National Democratic Redistricting\
      \ Committee put $165,000 into digital ads.\n\n\u201CShe strikes me as the kind\
      \ of judge who will direct rationality into the system,\u201D Holder said at\
      \ a mid-March campaign stop for Dallet.\n\n[Eric Holder: Gerrymandering has\
      \ broken our democracy]\n\nRepublicans attempted to turn Dallet\u2019s liberal\
      \ support against her. State Sen. Leah Vukmir, a Republican challenging U.S.\
      \ Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), called on Dallet to \u201Capologize\u201D to\
      \ the family of a Border Patrol agent who died while Holder was attorney general.\
      \ Republicans repeatedly attacked Dallet for telling donors in San Francisco\
      \ that \u201Cyour values are our Wisconsin values that we\u2019ve lost along\
      \ the way.\u201D\n\nBut like many judicial races, the Wisconsin campaign frequently\
      \ came down to the judges\u2019 most controversial cases. In one ad, Dallet\
      \ said Screnock \u201Clet a child predator walk without time.\u201D In another\
      \ ad, from the Screnock-backing Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, Dallet\
      \ was accused of giving her own light sentence to a child molester. On Tuesday,\
      \ after Dallet claimed the ad was false, WMC filed a judicial ethics complaint\
      \ against her.\n\n\u201CWe believe that Wisconsin\u2019s court is best served\
      \ by justices who interpret the law as it is written, instead of legislating\
      \ from the bench by imparting their personal views on court cases,\u201D WMC\

      \ even as he has kept up a hectic travel schedule and visited 228 of the state\u2019\

      \ re-election campaign at a venue that has become one of his favorite political\
      \ backdrops \u2014 the Redneck Country Club in Stafford, 17 miles southwest\
      \ of downtown Houston. His speech and his surroundings were plastered with references\
      \ to his new campaign slogan: \u201CTough as Texas.\u201D It is meant to evoke\
      \ the resilience of the state as it reeled from and united in the aftermath\
      \ of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nAt a campaign event on Tuesday night in San Antonio,\

      \ left giving millions of dollars to liberal Democrats running for office, and\
      \ it underscores that Republicans cannot take November for granted.\u201D\n\n\
      Mr. Cruz remains popular with Texas conservatives, particularly the Tea Party\
      \ activists who helped him, back in 2012, clinch the Senate seat by defeating\
      \ one of the most powerful Republicans in Texas, David Dewhurst, then the lieutenant\
      \ governor. And Republicans continue to dominate Texas, culturally and politically,\
      \ controlling both chambers of the Texas Legislature, the governor\u2019s mansion\
      \ and all of the more than two dozen statewide-elected offices. Democrats have\
      \ not won any statewide offices since 1994.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201CCruz has built-in\

      \ his name, so his candidacy was effectively born on third base,\u201D said\
      \ Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of\

      t want to be the hare who naps while the tortoise passes him by. O\u2019Rourke\u2019\
      s fund-raising should be an eye opener for Senator Cruz.\u201D\n\nTexas Democrats\
      \ have been in this position before. In 2014, Democrats had believed that Wendy\
      \ Davis would become the first Democratic governor in decades, but Ms. Davis\
      \ lost and Greg Abbott won. In 2016, Democrats had believed that Hillary Clinton\

      \ the Democrat, Tony Sanchez, a Laredo oil executive, spent $67 million and\
      \ lost to Mr. Perry. They said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s reputation among Texas conservatives\

      For the second time in recent weeks, a resolution denouncing neo-Nazis and white
      nationalists has died in the Tennessee General Assembly.


      The first resolution, filed by Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, was killed
      in a House subcommittee in mid-March after Clemmons failed to receive a second
      motion to discuss the resolution.

      against neo-Nazis

      won''t say


      Clemmons had filed it days after the deadly Aug. 12 white nationalist "Unite
      the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va.


      Last week, House Republican Caucus Chairman Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville,
      sponsored a nearly identical version of Clemmons'' resolution that omitted a
      paragraph urging law enforcement to recognize and pursue white nationalist groups
      as "domestic terrorist organizations."


      The resolution was scheduled to go to the Delayed Bills Committee Tuesday, but
      Williams on Monday evening requested that it be withdrawn from consideration
      by the committee.


      In a statement, Williams said the "bill''s caption was too narrow and couldn''t
      be amended to incorporate additional feedback gathered from our members over
      the past couple of days," though it wasn''t immediately clear what kind of input
      Williams had received on the resolution from other Republicans.

      Williams said he introduced his revised version of the resolution after receiving
      feedback from other Republicans, but since doing so had received additional
      input.


      He did not elaborate on the concerns Republicans had expressed to him regarding
      the resolution or what changes would need to be made in order for it to pass.


      "I still believe it is important for our General Assembly to condemn groups
      that support racism and hatred," he said in the statement. "I look forward to
      working with members on both sides of the aisle on a future resolution which
      can meet the expectations of all of our House members, as well as the citizens
      of Tennessee."


      Clemmons previously criticized Republicans for plagiarizing his bill language
      after declining to hear the resolution, describing them as "the only people
      in this state who would ever require a second chance to denounce neo-Nazis and
      their acts of violence."

      \ and our junior senator are doing right now,\" he said at an event hosted by\
      \ The Texas Tribune. O'Rourke was being interviewed by the Tribune's CEO, Evan\
      \ Smith. \"They want you to be afraid of Mexicans. When they call them rapists\
      \ and criminals, and say only a wall will keep them out.\"\n\nO'Rourke is challenging\
      \ Cruz in the November election. During the interview, he often referred to\
      \ Cruz as \"our junior senator,\" rather than by name. And he criticized Cruz\

      \ wants to secure the border and end sanctuary cities must be a bigot and 'hate\

      At the same time, O'Rourke addressed criticism that he failed to consolidate\

      \ not at that point \u2014 maybe still do not today \u2014 know who I am, and\
      \ that's on me to do.\"\n\nHe then stressed that he spent a great deal of time\
      \ away from the state's Democratic strongholds, courting votes in conservative\
      \ and rural bastions.\n\n\"The strategy leading up to the March 6 primary was\
      \ really a much longer strategy leading up to the November 6 general election,\"\
      \ he added. \"You will see me far more often in the border than you have seen\
      \ me so far.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nOn the\
      \ issue of guns, O'Rourke said he does not own firearms, but does not \"want\
      \ to take anyone's guns\" or repeal the Second Amendment.\n\n\"In the five-and-a-half\
      \ years I've been in Congress, we've had precisely zero debates on gun safety\
      \ as tens of thousands of our fellow Americans are killed every year in gun\
      \ violence,\" he said.\n\n\"We still don't have universal background checks,\
      \ so millions of gun sales are going through without any background check whatsoever\
      \ right now \u2014 even though we know that, in those states that have adopted\
      \ them, we see a 50 percent reduction in gun violence against an intimate partner.\"\
      \n\nAs for the tax rate, O'Rourke said that the country is in need of infrastructure\
      \ investments, particularly in broadband internet to rural regions, and that\
      \ tax hikes might be needed.\n\n\"I think for some, the very wealthiest among\
      \ us, for corporations, taxes are too low,\" he said. \"I don't think they need\

      \ Meagher & Flom and the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan, was also\
      \ ordered to pay a $20,000 fine.\n\nAlex Van der Zwaan outside court in Washington\
      \ on Feb. 20. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nVan der Zwaan faced up\
      \ to six months in prison after pleading guilty on Feb. 20 to lying in an interview\
      \ with prosecutors and FBI agents. He admitted to misleading them about his\
      \ discussions with Rick Gates, Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman,\
      \ and about his work with a man who prosecutors say was a Russian military intelligence\
      \ officer.\n\n\u201CHe was essentially caught red-handed,\u201D U.S. District\
      \ Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in federal court in Washington. She said that\
      \ van der Zwaan\u2019s lies were especially troubling because Mueller\u2019\
      s investigation involves questions of national security and \u201Cpotential\
      \ foreign interference in the democratic process that is fundamental to our\
      \ freedoms.\u201D\n\nThe judge said she would recommend to U.S. authorities\
      \ that van der Zwaan be confined at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania,\
      \ followed by two months of supervised release.\n\nGuilty Pleas\n\nVan der Zwaan,\
      \ who asked Jackson to spare him time behind bars, was the fifth person to plead\
      \ guilty in Mueller\u2019s investigation of whether Russia colluded with anyone\
      \ in the successful campaign of President Donald Trump. Van der Zwaan, who is\
      \ not cooperating, claims he lied to protect his job and not anyone else.\n\n\
      \u201CWhat I did was wrong,\u201D van der Zwaan said. \u201CI apologize to the\
      \ court for my conduct. I apologize to my wife and family.\u201D\n\nAlthough\
      \ Mueller\u2019s office didn\u2019t recommend a particular sentence, prosecutor\
      \ Andrew Weissmann urged the judge to send a message to \u201Creflect the gravity\
      \ of the offense.\u201D Van der Zwaan, he said, had a \u201Chistory of conduct\
      \ that\u2019s either criminal or shows a real lack of morality.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
      We count on people to tell us the truth,\u201D Weissmann said. \u201CPeople\
      \ need to know that there are consequences to withholding documents and consequences\
      \ to lying to the government.\u201D\n\nLondon Resident\n\nLawyers for van der\
      \ Zwaan, who lives in London, suggested he\u2019d been punished enough by having\
      \ to live in limbo in the U.S. in recent months. \u201CHe\u2019s going to go\
      \ home without a profession or a career,\u201D said defense attorney William\
      \ Schwartz. But the judge rejected Schwartz\u2019s request that he only pay\
      \ a fine and return to his pregnant wife in London.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re not\
      \ talking about a traffic ticket,\u201D Jackson said. \u201CThis was lying in\
      \ the course of a federal criminal investigation.\u201D\n\nProsecutors said\
      \ the lies van der Zwaan told involved his work with Gates and a reputed Russian\
      \ spy referred to as Person A in court filings. The description of Person A\
      \ matches Konstantin Kilimnik, who has denied spying but declined to comment\
      \ further.\n\nKilimnik worked for Gates and his longtime business partner, former\
      \ Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, when they served as political consultants\
      \ in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Manafort and Gates secretly coordinated an extensive\
      \ lobbying campaign in the U.S. to benefit former President Viktor Yanukovych\
      \ of Ukraine before he fled to Moscow.\n\nLobbying Work\n\nManafort and Gates\
      \ were indicted on Oct. 27, accused of hiding their lobbying work and laundering\
      \ millions of dollars. Gates has pleaded guilty and is helping Mueller, while\
      \ Manafort faces additional charges of bank and tax fraud.\n\nAs part of the\
      \ lobbying effort, Skadden was hired in 2012 to produce a report on the prosecution\
      \ and trial of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, a Yanukovych rival. Van\
      \ der Zwaan helped produce the report, which largely defended the prosecution.\
      \ Western leaders said the case against Tymoshenko was politically motivated.\n\
      \nIn pleading guilty, van der Zwaan admitted he talked several times to Gates\
      \ and Person A in September and October 2016, when they feared that Ukraine\
      \ might bring criminal charges over the report and how the firm was paid. Van\
      \ der Zwaan said he secretly recorded some calls with Gates, Person A and a\
      \ senior Skadden partner, former White House counsel Greg Craig.\n\nBut when\
      \ van der Zwaan flew from London to Washington for an interview with investigators\
      \ on Nov. 3, 2017, he lied about those 2016 contacts. He was represented by\
      \ Skadden lawyers and feared he could be fired for taping his boss, his lawyer\
      \ said.\n\nTape Recordings\n\nWithin two weeks, during a second interview with\
      \ investigators, van der Zwaan admitted his lies. He produced the tape recordings\
      \ as well as some emails he had concealed. Those emails included language about\
      \ him exploring \u201Copportunities to leave Skadden to work directly for Gates\
      \ and Manafort,\u201D according to a defense filing.\n\nWeissmann said van der\
      \ Zwaan leaked a copy of the Tymoshenko report to Gates, allowing him to spin\
      \ the conclusions, despite Skadden saying the process was independent.\n\nThe\
      \ two sides in the van der Zwaan case have clashed over what drove him to lie.\
      \ Jackson said she didn\u2019t know what van der Zwaan\u2019s motive may have\
      \ been, but she speculated that he\u2019d become fascinated with the work that\
      \ Gates and Manafort were doing and sought to ingratiate himself with them.\n\
      \nThe case is U.S. v. Van der Zwaan, 18-cr-00031, U.S. District Court, District\

      \ His friend, Hawaii resident Myah Baeza, started the conversation in a March\

      \ gay people \u201Cf-gs\u201D before issuing a hasty apology Monday calling\
      \ his comments \u201Csatire.\"\n\nBaeza told KARK-TV Monday that her initial\
      \ post was to support a friend who said \u201Cmy blood is too gay to save a\
      \ life.\u201D In response, Baeza said, \u201CKnowing that my gay friends can\u2019\
      t give blood, that has always not sat well with me.\u201D Baeza told Newsweek\
      \ that \"networking nowadays is having Facebook and adding each other to discuss\
      \ and debate online.\" Baeza explained that her political ideology is in between\
      \ a Republican and a Libertarian and she has made dozens of mutal friends and\
      \ acquaintances on Facebook with people of similar ideals -- including Jones.\n\
      \nBut Baeza told Newsweek Tuesday that she \"didn't previously see anything\
      \ extremely inflammatory but his true colors showed after the post\" about HIV\
      \ and homosexuality.\n\nScreenshot: Justin Jones/Myah Baeza Facebook\n\n\u201C\
      I just like to have diverse, transitive thought throughout my social media,\u201D\
      \ Baeza said.\n\nBut Baeza\u2019s Facebook friend, Jones, lashed out at her\
      \ commentary.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"The\
      \ likelihood of a f-g catching HIV is 1000% more likely then [sic] any straight\
      \ person,\u201D Jones responded on Facebook. \u201CF-gs are disgusting.\u201D\
      \n\nWhen pressed by Baeza asking, \u201CWhy in God\u2019s name would you say\
      \ that?\u201D Jones continued his homophobic rant.\n\n\"If you don't think HIV\
      \ is created by homosexuality then you need education. That's the entirety of\
      \ my post, for someone who wants free speech, you don't act like it. I shouldn't\
      \ have said 'f-gs' should have said homosexuals. But I won't apologize of the\
      \ moral of my comment, homosexuality is wrong, and shouldn't be publicly endorsed,\u201D\
      \ Jones\u2019 comment said.\n\nTop responses to Jones obtained by the Arkansas\
      \ Times from fellow libertarian-minded friends of his on Facebook expressed\
      \ shock and anger and screenshots clearly showed he had no support for his commentary.\n\
      \n\u201CSatire? I know satire sir, and that was not satire,\u201D said Bobbi\
      \ Hicks, who is running for the Arkansas Senate in District 10. \u201CWhat that\
      \ is, however, is a comment that is going to lead potential voters to have the\
      \ wrong idea about the LP and what we stand for. As a candidate I will likely\
      \ have to answer for your offensive comment.\u201D\n\nBaeza told Newsweek her\
      \ initial reaction was wondering \"how am I friends with this guy?\" and how\
      \ she'd not caught on to his commentary before. \"What he said was not only\
      \ scientifically incorrect, but also offensive and outlandish and unnecessary,\"\
      \ she added.\n\nScreenshot: Justin Jones website\n\nOn Monday, Jones issued\
      \ a hasty, signed statement to KARK-TV after Baeza handed over screenshots of\
      \ his comments. He also posted the \"satire\" non-apology on his candidacy page,\
      \ where it concludes that he'd like to get back to \"Making Arkansas Great Again.\"\
      \ Baeza said he told her \"I'm sorry you're offended\" in the immediate aftermath\
      \ to his comment.\n\n\"I recently made a comment that was meant to be satire,\
      \ but had FACTUAL meaning. In the new day of Social Media, we face backlash\
      \ for every comment we make, which is putting 'Free Speech' at a price. The\
      \ Aids Epidemic is a VERY big part of the LGBTQ Community. To not recognize\

      \ and how that didn't work. Today, we are bringing back 'FREEDOM OF SPEECH,'\
      \ and protecting our 2nd amendment rights. That might be too much for some people,\
      \ but that's why we're getting them out of Public Office. Let's get back to\
      \ 'Making Arkansas Great Again.' Vote Justin Jones for State Representative,\
      \ District 87.\"\n\nBaeza told KARK-TV she wants Jones to resign. Chairman of\
      \ the Libertarian Party of Arkansas, Dr. Michael Pakko, issued a statement Tuesday\
      \ denouncing Jones\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201CThe tone of Mr. Jones' comments\
      \ are completely antithetical to the inclusive, tolerant position of the Libertarian\
      \ Party. We believe that the rights of the individual are paramount - that each\
      \ person has the right to make decisions for themselves about what activities\
      \ to pursue, what foods to eat, what beverages to drink, and who to love. On\
      \ the rights of LGBT individuals, in particular, the Libertarian Party has always\
      \ been a champion of equal rights,\u201D Pakko\u2019s statement said.\n\nPakko\
      \ also touted libertarian ideology as being onboard with marriage equality and\
      \ keeping the government out of people\u2019s private sex lives before Republicans\
      \ or Democrats.\n\n\u201CGovernment does not have the authority to define, license\
      \ or restrict personal relationships. Consenting adults should be free to choose\
      \ their own sexual practices and personal relationships,\u201D Pakko added.\n\
      \nScreenshot: Justin Jones For District 87\n\nIn addition to facing Lundstrum\
      \ in November's election, Jones will also challenge Democrat Kelly Scott Unger\
      \ for the seat. Unger issued a statement to Newsweek Tuesday afternoon denouncing\
      \ the \"disgusting and derogatory statements\" from Jones.\n\n\u201CI am horrified\
      \ by the nature and content of these statements; there is absolutely no place\
      \ for this type of dialogue in our public discourse,\" said Unger. \"The rhetoric\
      \ around how we treat people must change. This behavior may be encouraged and\
      \ tolerated on the national level, but that\u2019s not how we treat people in\

    text: "California has proposed legislation that would require social platforms\
      \ like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to identify automated accounts, or bots,\
      \ amid a push by state lawmakers to police the technology companies that have\
      \ proven vulnerable to manipulation and the spread of fake news.\n\nBots, which\
      \ can be purchased or created by individuals or organizations, have been used\
      \ to inflate influence or amplify divisive opinions in politics and national\
      \ tragedies. In the recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,\
      \ for example, bots with suspected links to Russia released hundreds of posts\
      \ to weigh in on the gun control debate. Russia-linked bots on Twitter shared\
      \ Donald Trump\u2019s tweets almost half a million times during the final months\
      \ of the 2016 election campaign, compared with fewer than 50,000 retweets for\
      \ Hillary Clinton\u2019s account.\n\n\"We need to know if we are having debates\
      \ with real people or if we\u2019re being manipulated,\" said Democratic State\
      \ Senator Bob Hertzberg, who introduced the bill. \"Right now we have no law\
      \ and it\u2019s just the Wild West.\"\n\nThe proposed bill would would make\
      \ it illegal for bots to communicate with a person in the state with \"the intention\
      \ of misleading and without clearly and conspicuously disclosing that the bot\
      \ is not a natural person.\" It would require the social platforms to let people\
      \ report violations, respond to those reports, and provide bimonthly details\
      \ of those violations to the state Attorney General. The legislation is scheduled\
      \ to go through two committees in California this month.\n\nStates -- especially\
      \ California, where many of the tech companies are based -- are moving ahead\
      \ to regulate social media in the face of slow progress from the federal government.\
      \ New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic-dominated state Assembly\
      \ are working to push through a law that would require election ads on social\
      \ media to reveal the identity of the buyer. California State Assemblyman Marc\
      \ Levine, a democrat, introduced a bill similar to Hertzberg\u2019s, requiring\
      \ tech companies to brand bots with a disclaimer and link those accounts and\
      \ advertising purchases to \" verified human accounts.\"\n\n\"California feels\
      \ a bit guilty about how our hometown companies have had a negative impact on\
      \ society as a whole,\u201D said Shum Preston, the national director of advocacy\
      \ and communications at Common Sense Media, a major supporter of Hertzberg\u2019\
      s bill. \u201CWe are looking to regulate in the absence of the federal government.\
      \ We don\u2019t think anything is coming from Washington.\"\n\nLegislation with\
      \ bipartisan support in Congress, the Honest Ads Act, has focused on regulating\
      \ online election ads. The Federal Election Commission is also considering a\
      \ proposal to require online ads to carry the same disclaimers from sponsors\
      \ as do radio, television and print ads. California\u2019s proposals would address\
      \ the broader problem of manipulation on the technology platforms, but they\
      \ would be difficult to enforce. The platforms say they can\u2019t always easily\
      \ identify what accounts are bots, as software programs become more sophisticated\
      \ and mix human interactions with automation.\n\nRecent revelations have forced\
      \ Facebook and Twitter to come to grips with the extent of malicious software\
      \ programs on their platforms that have real-life consequences. Researchers\
      \ have estimated that as many as 15 percent of Twitter\u2019s active accounts\
      \ are bots and Facebook has estimated that as many as 150 million people were\
      \ exposed to Russian propaganda through fake accounts on issues from gun rights\
      \ to immigration and race relations.\n\nTwitter has been escalating efforts\
      \ to combat bots, by tweaking its algorithms and suspending more automated accounts\
      \ that break the rules. Facebook and Google have also taken steps to increase\
      \ transparency, including hiring more people to review content."

      \ Appropriations Committee to answer questions about the administration\u2019\
      s first year in office. While I had no shortage of questions for her, one of\
      \ my top priorities was asking her about her department\u2019s failure to protect\
      \ the rights of transgender students.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the\
      \ Department of Education issued guidance to public schools explaining that\
      \ schools should allow students to use restrooms consistent with their gender\
      \ identity in accordance with basic civil rights law under Title IX.\n\nI heard\
      \ from plenty of teachers and administrators throughout Wisconsin who were either\
      \ already acting in accordance with the new rule, or gladly welcomed guidance\
      \ on this important issue.\n\nHowever, Secretary DeVos rescinded the Obama-era\
      \ guidance in 2017, robbing transgender students of rights which should be afforded\
      \ to every public school student.\n\nIn February of this year, Secretary DeVos\
      \ continued to discriminate against transgender students by announcing that\
      \ her department would not investigate any complaints filed by transgender students\
      \ who had been banned from restrooms that match their gender identity.\n\nWhen\
      \ this happened, I couldn\u2019t help but think of Ashton Whitaker, a young\
      \ man from my home town of Kenosha, Wisconsin, who is currently a first year\
      \ student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2016, Ashton rightly challenged\
      \ his school to allow him to use the restroom consistent with his gender identity.\
      \ Courts affirmed that forcing this young man to use the wrong restroom constituted\
      \ illegal discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nIn 2018, we should not need\
      \ a refresher on basic discrimination. Rescinding someone\u2019s rights, which\
      \ have been upheld in court, on the basis of their gender identity is wrong.\
      \ Refusing to listen to complaints from a certain population of students is\
      \ wrong.\n\nSecretary DeVos has consistently shown her willful ignorance when\
      \ failing to visit underperforming schools, as well as her mean-spirited, anti-LGBT\
      \ views when denying rights to certain students. At some point, she should realize\
      \ that as Secretary of Education, she is supposed to represent all students,\
      \ not just a select few."

      \ from recent years.\n\nDallet questioned the wisdom of court decisions that\
      \ upheld Act 10, the 2011 law that all but ended collective bargaining for public\
      \ workers. As a lawyer, Screnock defended Act 10 in court.\n\nDallet opposed\
      \ a 2015 state Supreme Court decision that shut down an investigation into Walker\
      \ and other Republicans. Screnock said he believed the court got that ruling\
      \ right by finding that candidates and political groups can work together on\
      \ campaigns.\n\nDallet said there was \"no reason\" for assault-style rifles\
      \ like the AR-15, while Screnock got the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.\n\
      \nAttention toward the end of the campaign focused on an ad by the state's largest\
      \ business lobbying group, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, that criticized\
      \ Dallet for sentencing a man to two years in prison for attempted sexual assault\
      \ of a child when she could have put him behind bars for up to 20 years.\n\n\
      The victim's family called for the ad to be taken off the air because the ad\
      \ made it easy to identify the victim. WMC declined to alter or remove the ad\
      \ and Screnock defended that decision, saying the group had a right to run ads\
      \ as it wished and he would not weigh in on matters of public interest because\
      \ he is a judge.\n\nOn Tuesday, WMC Chief Executive Officer Kurt Bauer filed\
      \ a complaint with the state Judicial Commission alleging Dallet had violated\
      \ the state's judicial ethics code by misrepresenting facts about WMC's ad.\
      \ Specifically, Bauer said Dallet's campaign called the WMC ad false when it\
      \ was not and referred to the ad as being one by Screnock rather than WMC.\n\
      \nIf the commission were to determine Dallet violated ethics rules, it would\
      \ have to present its findings to the Supreme Court. Only the high court can\
      \ make a ruling on whether judicial ethics rules have been broken and, if so,\
      \ what to do about it.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Screnock and Republicans\
      \ hammered Dallet for holding a fundraiser in San Francisco and telling the\
      \ crowd there \"your values are our Wisconsin values that we\u2019ve lost along\
      \ the way.\"\n\nDallet had the financial edge in the race, raising more than\
      \ $1 million. Screnock raised about $800,000, with more than $300,000 coming\
      \ from the state Republican Party.\n\nAs is typical in these races, political\

      (CNN) We know the President isn''t exactly a policy wonk, and that he plays
      fast and loose with the facts in favor of broad strokes intended to froth up
      his most loyal supporters. But he''s also shown that he plays fast and loose

      to be less "The West Wing" and more "The Hunger Games" are largely staying quiet
      about their experiences (or at least not attaching their names to the commentary
      they whisper to the press). But one woman whose family found itself on the receiving
      end of President Donald Trump''s factually-challenged ire is speaking out


      Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, former state congressional candidate, and the wife
      of recently-fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, published an op-ed in Tuesday''s
      Washington Post detailing the ways in which, she said, Trump''s attacks had
      harmed her family financially, socially, and psychologically.


      Trump claimed , for example, that donations made to Ms. McCabe''s campaign for
      Virginia state senate by Virginia''s Democratic then-governor Terry McAuliffe
      influenced the FBI''s investigation into Hillary Clinton''s private email server.
      Just one problem: Andrew McCabe, who was supposedly swayed by the money directed
      to his wife''s run, wasn''t yet the FBI''s deputy director; the position he
      was in didn''t give him decision-making power over the Clinton investigation.
      Andrew McCabe didn''t begin work on the Clinton investigation until after his
      wife had lost her race.


      Ethical safeguards are in place for a reason, and there should absolutely be
      heightened scrutiny on an FBI higher-up whose spouse or other family member
      is running for elected office. But this isn''t about ethics or scrutiny. It''s
      about a political gotcha from an unhinged, vindictive President who doesn''t
      care whose life he torches in a bullying tweet.


      How do we surmise this? For several years now we''ve seen Donald Trump attack
      everyone from teenage girls to professional journalists to sitting senators
      and prisoners of war. He crosses lines once considered sacred, and his base
      cheers.


      It''s also rich, this concern with ethics and impropriety, coming from a President
      who has thrown the ethics book out the window. Now seems like a good time to
      mention that Donald Trump still hasn''t released his tax returns, despite what
      he promised in the campaign. He owns a hotel near the White House, and his family
      profits when foreign dignitaries stay there. American taxpayers fund his trips
      to Mar-a-Lago, his own private club.


      His Cabinet members are no better, the most recent example being Environmental
      Protection Agency director Scott Pruitt, who was caught accepting what can only
      be termed a sweetheart housing deal from lobbyists and using public money for
      exorbitant travel expenses. Trump told Pruitt he has his back. Tom Price had
      to step down from his Health and Human Services post because of his habit of
      funding private jet travel with taxpayer funds. And Housing and Urban Development
      chief Ben Carson still has his job, despite ordering tens of thousands of dollars
      of office furniture on the taxpayer''s dime.


      Trump seems to believe the rules don''t apply to him -- and to be fair, so far,
      he''s been right. He was elected President, after all, and has paid virtually
      no political cost for knowing virtually nothing about policy; for wasting millions
      of taxpayer dollars on golf getaways; for allegations that he had an affair
      with a porn star and sexually harassed and/or assaulted other women; and for
      attacking -- largely via Twitter -- private citizens like Jill McCabe.

      ... MUST WATCH Trump to embattled EPA chief: "We got your back" 03:19


      But that doesn''t mean his actions are cost-free. Only it''s others who bear
      them -- human beings swept up in his incoherent and mean-spirited tirades, and
      regular people like Jill McCabe, who ran for office because, as an emergency
      room pediatrician, she thought maybe she could help outside of the ER in addition
      to in it.


      Most of Trump''s victims are cowed into silence; we never hear what this has
      cost them. McCabe''s story, with its visceral details -- fearing opening packages
      from strangers and worrying about her teenage children -- should prick the conscience
      of every American who has given Trump''s bad behavior a pass, either out of
      political sympathy or simple exhaustion. This is not normal, and it must fall
      on all of us, not just the bravest of Trump''s victims, to demand consequences.


      Malevolent loudmouth attacks on citizens who pursue public service are beneath
      the dignity of a sitting president. But then, this President has no dignity
      to lower.'

    text: "Can Kansas lawmakers spend $500 million more on public schools without\
      \ raising your taxes or cutting spending elsewhere?\n\nYes, they can, if current\
      \ projections turn out to be correct. But it\u2019s a big if.\n\nThe House passed\
      \ a school funding plan on Tuesday that would phase in a $500 million increase\
      \ for K-12 education over five years. Lawmakers passed the bill 71-53 after\
      \ rejecting it a day earlier.\n\nIts fate is unclear after Senate Republican\
      \ leaders said the Senate will not debate school finance until the Legislature\
      \ passes a constitutional amendment that would restrict future lawsuits over\
      \ funding.\n\nNever miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free\
      \ trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe bill, HB 2445, is\
      \ the first Republican-supported response to a Kansas Supreme Court decision\
      \ last fall that lawmakers aren\u2019t adequately funding schools. That opinion\
      \ came as part of a lawsuit over funding brought by a group of school districts,\
      \ including Wichita.\n\nThe Legislature has until the end of April to submit\
      \ a plan for adequate funding to the court.\n\nSupporters of the House bill\
      \ say the state budget can absorb the additional spending, assuming that revenue\
      \ comes in as expected and that they don\u2019t spend significantly more on\
      \ other parts of government.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore-conservative Republicans say the\
      \ current increase is unaffordable and will keep lawmakers from spending more\
      \ on other parts of government that need it.\n\nUnder the plan passed by the\
      \ House, Kansas would have about $60 million more in revenue than expenditures\
      \ by 2022, according to one set of projections used by Republicans. The projections\
      \ don't extend out the full five years of the plan, only the first four, leaving\
      \ the effect of the final year unknown.\n\nThe state would start off with $367\
      \ million left over in 2019, but the amount would fall each year.\n\nThe projection\
      \ is built on several assumptions: that Kansas funds its pension system at levels\
      \ required by law, that it brings in more than $90 million each year from internet\
      \ sales tax, and that federal tax changes boost revenue to the state by roughly\
      \ $150 million each year.\n\n\u201CThe trend is such, while it is declining\
      \ in that ending balance, I think we can handle this situation with those revenue\
      \ sources,\u201D said Rep. Steven Johnson, an Assaria Republican who chairs\
      \ the House Tax Committee.\n\n\u201CHopefully we\u2019ll have enough time to\
      \ assess: Has there been any growth in internet sales tax, continuing growth\
      \ in income tax or other types of things where we could see that growth that\
      \ would fund us through that time.\u201D\n\nAn unexpected event, like a recession,\
      \ could leave the state with less revenue and require cuts or tax increases.\n\
      \nTaxpayers can\u2019t afford the new spending, said Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita\
      \ Republican.\n\nThe bill \u201Cthrows more money at a system that has proven\
      \ itself to be inefficient\u201D and is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars,\
      \ Whitmer said. It is a \u201Cbetrayal of their trust,\u201D he said.\n\nState\
      \ officials and researchers will issue new forecasts later this month predicting\
      \ how much revenue the state will receive in the coming months and years. Some\
      \ expect the forecast to be more optimistic and increase the amount of revenue\
      \ that is expected because of the economy\u2019s continued strength and unexpected\
      \ revenue from federal tax law changes.\n\nOn Monday, House Democrats offered\
      \ an amendment to increase the size of the school funding plan by more than\
      \ $200 million. Democrats said the state could have afforded the increase, but\
      \ the proposal failed.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat,\
      \ said $500 million is now likely the high watermark of what lawmakers may ultimately\
      \ send to Gov. Jeff Colyer. A Senate plan under development would add significantly\
      \ less than the House bill.\n\nWard responded to concerns about affordability\
      \ by saying that legislative projections about spending and revenue are typically\
      \ good for about three years but are less reliable the further out they\u2019\
      re extended.\n\n\u201CEvery Legislature is going to have to make adjustments\
      \ based on the economy of Kansas at the time and that\u2019s just what we\u2019\
      ve done for all my time up here,\u201D Ward said.\n\nHB 2445 now heads to the\
      \ Senate, where lawmakers may be less receptive to a $500 million increase.\n\
      \nA special Senate committee on school finance on Tuesday advanced a more modest\
      \ plan that would add about $250 million over five years. And Senate Republican\
      \ leaders said they won\u2019t work on any school funding bill without passage\
      \ of a constitutional amendment.\n\nAn amendment needs two-thirds support in\
      \ both the House and Senate to pass. It would then go to a statewide vote. A\
      \ House committee held a hearing Tuesday on a proposed amendment; the committee\
      \ is expected to debate the bill on Wednesday."

    text: "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 When porn star Stormy Daniels appears Sunday\
      \ night on \u201C60 Minutes,\u201D this much is clear: The segment won\u2019\
      t be family viewing in the White House.\n\nPresident Trump, who has been spending\
      \ the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., is scheduled to\
      \ return to the White House ahead of the highly anticipated interview. But first\
      \ lady Melania Trump, who traveled to Florida with the president on Friday,\
      \ is staying behind.\n\n\u201CThe First Lady will be staying in Florida as is\
      \ their tradition for spring break,\u201D White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters\
      \ said in a late Sunday morning statement.\n\n[ On eve of \u201860 Minutes\u2019\
      \ interview, Stormy Daniels says working in porn helped prepare her for public\
      \ scrutiny ]\n\nThere is no word on whether Trump will tune in to the broadcast\
      \ on CBS to hear Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, talk about\
      \ her alleged decade-old affair with him and the hush money she says she received\
      \ to keep it quiet.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been complaining to associates\
      \ here this weekend about all the media attention Daniels has been receiving,\
      \ according to people familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition\
      \ of anonymity to be candid. Among other inquiries, Trump asked one friend how\
      \ Daniels might affect his poll numbers.\n\nA friend of Trump and an attorney\
      \ for Daniels also sparred over the alleged affair on Sunday.\n\nAppearing on\
      \ ABC News\u2019s \u201CThis Week,\u201D Christopher Ruddy, chief executive\
      \ of Newsmax, said he had talked to Trump on Saturday and that the president\
      \ \u201Csaid he thought that, that much of the Stormy Daniels stuff was a political\
      \ hoax.\u201D\n\nMichael Avenatti, Daniels's attorney, responded sarcastically\
      \ on Twitter, comparing her claims to other \u201Choaxes\u201D such as the moon\
      \ landing.\n\n\u201CIs this, along with claims that I worked on some campaigns\
      \ 25 years ago, the best you guys can come upon with to discredit us?\u201D\
      \ Avenatti asked.\n\nOn the day before the airing of her interview, Daniels\
      \ told The Washington Post that her work in the porn industry has helped her\
      \ prepare for the international attention her claims have received.\n\n\u201C\
      Being in the adult industry, I\u2019ve developed a thick skin and maybe a little\
      \ bit of a dark sense of humor,\u201D she said Saturday. \u201CBut nothing could\
      \ truly prepare someone for this.\u201D"

    text: "Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin testifies about budgets for veterans\
      \ programs before the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee on March 21. (Jose\
      \ Luis Magana/AP)\n\nPresident Trump seemed on the verge of making more personnel\
      \ changes Sunday, following a whirlwind three weeks in which he has parted ways\
      \ with his chief economic adviser, his chief national security adviser, his\
      \ secretary of state, his communications director, his personal aide and two\
      \ of his lawyers \u2014 including one who lasted six days.\n\nAt his coastal\
      \ resort here, Trump told associates he wants to oust Veterans Affairs Secretary\
      \ David Shulkin. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax, talked to\
      \ the president Saturday and then said on television Sunday that Shulkin is\
      \ \u201Clikely to depart the Cabinet very soon.\u201D\n\nRuddy, who speaks to\
      \ Trump frequently, said on ABC News\u2019 \u201CThis Week\u201D that the president\
      \ thinks the White House is operating \u201Clike a smooth machine\u201D and\
      \ that he has been \u201Cperplexed\u201D by news reports of chaos.\n\n\u201C\
      He did say that he\u2019s expecting to make one or two major changes to his\
      \ government very soon,\u201D Ruddy said.\n\nTrump also said he wants to keep\
      \ two other senior administration officials who have been in his crosshairs\
      \ in recent weeks: his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and his housing secretary,\
      \ Ben Carson.\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has had a productive\
      \ first year, but now a leadership rift is threatening his position and the\
      \ agency's agenda. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nRuddy offered the same\
      \ assessment of Kelly and Carson on ABC.\n\nShulkin, 58, a physician and former\
      \ hospital executive who won unanimous confirmation by the Senate last year,\
      \ had been a favorite of Trump\u2019s, racking up legislative victories and\
      \ fast changes at an agency the president railed against on the campaign trail.\n\
      \nBut months of turmoil in the department\u2019s senior ranks have roiled the\
      \ \xADsecond-largest federal bureaucracy, which employs 360,000 people. Shulkin\
      \ has said publicly that high-level political appointees installed by the White\
      \ House are scheming to oust him over personality and policy differences.\n\n\
      Shulkin has been on the verge of leaving for several weeks, but White House\
      \ officials have been unable to find a replacement. And Trump \u2014 who detests\
      \ firing people even though he became famous for a \u201Cyou\u2019re fired\u201D\
      \ catchphrase \u2014 has griped but done nothing to oust Shulkin.\n\nRuddy\u2019\
      s comments came just before Joseph diGenova, a lawyer Trump had liked on Fox\
      \ News Channel, backed away from representing the president. On Monday, it was\
      \ announced that the aggressive lawyer would deal with a special counsel\u2019\
      s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, and\
      \ he helped precipitate the ouster of John Dowd, another lawyer, on Thursday.\
      \ Now, both lawyers are out \u2014 leaving Trump with a diminished team and\
      \ aides frantically searching for new lawyers.\n\nTrump defiantly said he didn\u2019\
      t need any more lawyers and crowed about his poll numbers, confidants said.\n\
      \n\u201CHe is creating his own reality,\u201D said one person who spoke to him\
      \ Friday afternoon.\n\nWhile in Florida, Trump also continued to attack Rex\
      \ Tillerson, saying in conversations with associates that the recently fired\
      \ secretary of state did not have the \u201Cbrains or energy\u201D for the job.\
      \ Trump seems to still be infuriated by Tillerson, said a person who spoke with\
      \ the president.\n\nSenior administration officials say Trump has bashed Tillerson\
      \ since firing him on Twitter. Among other things, Trump is upset about reports\
      \ that Tillerson had called him a \u201Cmoron.\u201D\n\nTrump also told one\
      \ friend that he was glad H.R. McMaster, his recently ousted national security\
      \ adviser, was no longer in the administration, and that he now has a team he\
      \ thinks will implement his agenda.\n\nTrump, associates said, also complained\
      \ about the media attention that porn star Stormy Daniels is receiving, calling\
      \ the entire episode a \u201Choax\u201D that opponents are using to attack him.\
      \ He asked one friend how Daniels, who was interviewed by CBS News\u2019s \u201C\
      60 Minutes\u201D about her alleged affair with Trump, was going to affect his\
      \ poll numbers.\n\nHe closely watched news coverage of a spending bill that\
      \ many conservatives disliked, including a scathing segment on \u201CJudge Jeanine,\u201D\
      \ a Fox News Channel program he likes. Jeanine Pirro, the fiery host, is an\
      \ occasional White House visitor.\n\nEven after signing the $1.3 trillion spending\
      \ bill, Trump complained that Republicans had trapped him into a bad situation\
      \ while saying he believed the backlash would be short-lived. Several aides\

      \ then, the president has struggled to find top-notch defense lawyers willing\

      \ special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his investigators have intensified\
      \ their focus on Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nBut Trump insisted in two tweets Sunday\

      \ March 25, 2018\n\nOn Sunday morning, Trump also continued to defend the $1.3\
      \ trillion budget, which specifies border funding is permitted only for \u201C\
      operationally effective designs deployed\u201D as of May 5, 2017. (That means\
      \ the money cannot be used to build any of the wall prototypes that Trump viewed\
      \ during a high-profile visit March 13 on the border.) At the last minute Friday,\
      \ the president threatened to veto the spending bill but then signed it into\
      \ law. Trump said that \u201Cmuch can be done\u201D with the funding that is\

    text: "Just hours after threatening a veto, President Trump said Friday afternoon\
      \ that he had signed a \u201Cridiculous\u201D $1.3 trillion spending bill passed\
      \ by Congress early Friday, averting a government shutdown.\n\nIn a morning\
      \ tweet, Trump said he might veto the omnibus bill because it did nothing to\
      \ address the fate of young undocumented immigrants known as \u201Cdreamers\u201D\
      \ and did not fully fund his border wall.\n\nBut speaking to reporters at the\
      \ White House about four hours later, Trump said he had decided to sign the\
      \ bill despite his reservations, arguing that it provides much-needed funding\
      \ for the military, including a pay increase for troops and new equipment.\n\
      \n\u201CMy highest duty is to keep America safe,\u201D Trump said. \u201CWe\
      \ need to take care of our military.\u201D\n\nStill, he voiced disdain for the\
      \ hasty way the bill was passed.\n\n\u201CI say to Congress, I will never sign\
      \ another bill like this again,\u201D Trump said, also calling on Congress to\
      \ give him a line-item veto, a tool that the Supreme Court has said is unconstitutional\
      \ for a president.\n\n\u201CThere are a lot of things that I\u2019m unhappy\
      \ about in this bill,\u201D he said later in his 20-minute remarks, telling\
      \ reporters that he had \u201Cvery seriously\u201D considered a veto.\n\n[ Why\
      \ did Trump threaten to veto a spending bill hours before he signed it? ]\n\n\
      The announcement, which Trump teased in a separate tweet an hour before, capped\
      \ off a wild morning in the White House and on Capitol Hill. Several aides scrambled\
      \ to persuade the president not to follow through with his veto threat.\n\n\
      In his tweet Friday morning, Trump said that those protected from deportation\
      \ by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program have\
      \ been \u201Ctotally abandoned\u201D by Congress, and he blamed the Democrats.\n\
      \nTrump, who decided last fall to end the DACA program, was seeking a deal that\
      \ would give Democrats protections they sought for the program's recipients\
      \ in exchange for additional funding of $25 billion for his long-promised U.S.-Mexico\
      \ border wall. The bill includes $1.6 billion for fencing and other border security\
      \ measures.\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on\
      \ the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned\
      \ by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is\
      \ desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded. \u2014 Donald\
      \ J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018\n\n\u201CI am considering a VETO\
      \ of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA\
      \ recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned\
      \ in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National\
      \ Defense, is not fully funded,\u201D Trump said in his tweet.\n\nIn his remarks\
      \ at the White House, Trump said he was disappointed in the level of border-security\
      \ funding but pledged to do as much as possible with it and to seek more money\
      \ from Congress.\n\nSaying he was addressing Hispanics, Trump argued that his\
      \ party is more interested in the fate of dreamers than Democrats are.\n\n\u201C\
      Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats, who are using you\
      \ for their own purposes,\u201D the president said. His aides have argued Democrats\
      \ are trying to use DACA as an election issue.\n\nPeople familiar with Trump\u2019\
      s thinking said the president was frustrated with the bill and the coverage\
      \ it was receiving, particularly on Fox News, where critics took aim at the\
      \ level of spending in the bill.\n\n\u201CHe doesn\u2019t care as much about\
      \ the spending levels, but he knows all of his conservative friends do,\u201D\
      \ said a senior White House official who requested anonymity to speak more candidly.\n\
      \nLawmakers have left town on a two-week recess, some of them on overseas trips\
      \ and with no plans to return to Washington. The House passed the bill midday\
      \ Thursday, and the Senate cleared the measure early Friday, shortly after midnight.\n\
      \n[ In late-night drama, Senate passes $1.3 trillion spending bill, averting\
      \ government shutdown ]\n\nTrump had until midnight Friday to sign a bill, or\
      \ a government shutdown would have ensued.\n\nThe legislation funds the federal\
      \ government for the remainder of the 2018 budget year, through Sept. 30, directing\
      \ $700 billion toward the military and $591 billion to domestic agencies. The\
      \ military spending is a $66 billion increase over the 2017 level, and the nondefense\
      \ spending is $52 billion more than last year.\n\nThe spending bill is widely\
      \ expected to be the last major legislation that Congress will pass before the\
      \ November midterm elections, increasing pressure to jam the bill full of odds\
      \ and ends, with provisions addressing areas as varied as guns and invasive\
      \ carp.\n\nThe lack of an immigration deal in the spending bill had set already\
      \ set off a round of recriminations, with the White House aggressively trying\
      \ to deflect responsibility.\n\nTrump\u2019s veto threat only intensified the\
      \ blame game Friday morning.\n\n\u201CLet's not forget that you ended DACA and\
      \ torpedoed every possible bipartisan fix. This is on you,\u201D Rep. Tim Ryan\
      \ (D-Ohio) said on Twitter.\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) accused Trump of making\
      \ a \u201Closer\u2019s bluff.\u201D\n\n\u201CGo ahead and veto the omnibus over\
      \ DACA. We dare you,\u201D Pocan said on Twitter. \u201CEveryone knows you\u2019\
      re the reason DACA recipients are abandoned.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers who\
      \ opposed the spending bill on other grounds used the occasion to urge Trump\
      \ to follow through with his threat.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), head of\
      \ the hard-right Freedom Caucus, urged Trump to veto the bill: \u201CThe@freedomcaucus\
      \ would fully support you in this move, Mr. President. Let's pass a short term\
      \ [continuing resolution] while you negotiate a better deal for the forgotten\
      \ men and women of America.\u201D\n\nAlso urging Trump to veto the bill was\
      \ Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who in a tweet Friday morning said: \u201CPlease\
      \ do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The\
      \ spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children\
      \ under the bus. Totally irresponsible.\u201D\n\nBefore the Senate\u2019s early-morning\
      \ vote Friday, Corker had complained about the process of rushing the bill through\
      \ Congress.\n\nSeveral other conservative lawmakers egged Trump on Friday morning,\
      \ complaining about the amount of spending and the rushed process. But there\
      \ was no indication that Trump shared those concerns.\n\nInstead, in his veto\
      \ threat Friday, Trump proposed something that conservative hard-liners have\
      \ largely rejected in recent months \u2014 trading dreamer protections for border-wall\
      \ money. Conservatives, emboldened by a White House proposal released in January,\
      \ have insisted that any immigration deal go further, cutting several programs\
      \ that allow foreign nationals to live in the United States legally.\n\nOther\
      \ senior Republicans made Twitter pleas urging Trump to sign the bill. Senate\
      \ Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) rattled off several policy wins in a Friday\
      \ tweet directed at the president, including a gun-related measure long championed\
      \ by the Texas Republican that was included in the 2,232-page spending measure.\n\
      \n\u201CWhile Ds obstructed normal appropriations process, forcing an Omnibus,\
      \ the benefits of Omnibus to national security, border security, opioid crisis,\
      \ infrastructure, school safety and fixing gun background check system are important\
      \ and will save lives. @realDonaldTrump,\u201D Cornyn tweeted Friday.\n\nSen.\
      \ Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) said of Trump\u2019s threat: \u201CI hope he doesn\u2019\
      t do it. That\u2019s my reaction.\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t think what we\
      \ did was the best thing we could have done,\u201D Isakson added. \u201CBut\
      \ it was the only thing we could have done, so to veto it wouldn\u2019t make\
      \ a lot of sense to me.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) sized up\
      \ the president\u2019s veto threat Friday morning this way: \u201CArt of the\
      \ Deal-Wrecker!\u201D He urged the president to sign the bill.\n\n\u201COne\
      \ day after his own [Office of Management and Budget] director said he would\
      \ sign it \u2026 he\u2019s now saying he\u2019s thinking about vetoing it,\u201D\
      \ Kaine told reporters. \u201CWhat, does he just want to create more confusion\
      \ and chaos? I don\u2019t get it.\u201D\n\nKaine said Trump\u2019s professed\
      \ concern about DACA recipients is not sincere, saying he walked away from an\
      \ offer from Democrats weeks ago to protect them in exchange for more border-security\
      \ funding.\n\n\u201CHe was the one who poured cold water on it and killed it\
      \ among the Republicans just a month ago,\u201D Kaine said.\n\nSen. Chris Van\
      \ Hollen (D-Md.) said: \u201CThis is classic Trump. He says one thing and then\
      \ he does something completely different.\u201D\n\nVan Hollen added, \u201C\
      He\u2019s actually one of the worst negotiators I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201D\n\
      \nAlthough Trump aides declared Thursday that Trump intended to sign the bill,\
      \ there were signs of his displeasure with various aspects of it.\n\nOn Wednesday,\
      \ House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) rushed to the White House to reassure\
      \ Trump.\n\nThe president was upset with the lack of money for his border wall,\
      \ and he griped about a proposed tunnel between New York and New Jersey \u2014\
      \ a project beloved by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2014\
      \ that Trump tried to block as part of the negotiations.\n\nVeto threats were\
      \ made then, too, but after conversations with Ryan and Senate Majority Leader\
      \ Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the White House issued a statement saying Trump supported\
      \ the bill.\n\n\u201CIs the president going to sign the bill? The answer is\
      \ yes,\u201D Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget,\
      \ told reporters at the White House on Thursday afternoon.\n\nOn Thursday, the\
      \ White House also issued a lengthy release titled \u201CThe American People\

      \nPresident Trump on Wednesday criticized his own Justice Department for not\
      \ urging the Supreme Court to get involved in a fight over whether Arizona can\
      \ deny driver\u2019s licenses to the young undocumented immigrants known as\
      \ \u201Cdreamers.\u201D\n\nIn a morning tweet, Trump said he agreed with Fox\
      \ News commentator Lou Dobbs, who criticized the inaction on a Tuesday night\
      \ segment of his show.\n\n\u201CAre you kidding me?\u201D Dobbs asked his viewers,\
      \ after recounting the case.\n\n\u201CDepartment of Justice should have urged\
      \ the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants\

      \ immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism\
      \ is the latest he has leveled at the Justice Department and Attorney General\
      \ Jeff Sessions. Among other things, he has called its handling of the probe\
      \ into Russian election interference \u201Ca disgrace.\u201D\n\nThe tweet also\
      \ comes as Trump claims he is more interested in finding a permanent solution\
      \ than Democrats in Congress for the fate of those enrolled in a program started\
      \ under President Barack Obama that protects \u201Cdreamers\u201D from deportation.\n\
      \nThe Arizona case grew out of a decision by then-Gov. Jan Brewer to block participants\
      \ in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program from qualifying for\
      \ drivers\u2019 licenses in her state. She announced the policy shortly after\
      \ Obama launched the DACA program in 2012.\n\nBrewer argued Arizona was simply\
      \ enforcing a long-standing policy of issuing licenses only to those who can\
      \ prove they are in the country legally.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union\
      \ sued Arizona on behalf of a group of DACA recipients who were denied driver\u2019\
      s licenses. A federal appeals court ruled in their favor, saying U.S. immigration\
      \ law prohibits states from making distinctions among different classes of noncitizens.\n\
      \nArizona would have been the only state to bar DACA recipients from getting\
      \ driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department recommended the Supreme\
      \ Court not hear an appeal, saying the questions in the case \u201Chave been\
      \ overtaken by events.\u201D In effect, the department argued that Trump\u2019\
      s plans to rescind the program means the state\u2019s concerns have already\
      \ been addressed.\n\nOn Monday, without comment, the Supreme Court let the appeals\
      \ court decision stand.\n\nOn his program Tuesday, Dobbs discussed the decision\
      \ with high-profile lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who cautioned Dobbs that the Supreme\
      \ Court could address the issues at hand in a future case.\n\n\u201CStay tuned,\u201D\
      \ Dershowitz said. \u201CThis is just one step in a longer process.\u201D\n\n\
      During the same segment Dershowitz offered his views on the ongoing investigation\
      \ by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible collusion between Trump\u2019\
      s 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nDershowitz repeated his view that he\u2019s not\
      \ a fan of special counsels generally.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re told to try to\
      \ find crimes, whether crimes exist or not,\u201D he said. \u201CI was opposed\
      \ to the appointment of Mueller to be special counsel. I still am opposed to\
      \ it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have\
      \ been a special counsel appointed because there was no probable cause for believing\
      \ that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice.\u201D\
      \n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump memorialized those comments in a pair of tweets\
      \ that repeatedly referred to the special counsel as the \u201Cspecial council.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CSpecial Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or\
      \ not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am\

      \ over whether federal record-keeping and disclosure requirements should have\
      \ applied ahead of the 2010 elections to the conservative-leaning American Action\

      \ to influence elections, and therefore subject to federal disclosure requirements\
      \ of who paid for the ads.\n\nThe FEC deadlocked on both complaints along party\

      \ its previous dismissals within 30 days, per the ruling. The FEC said it does\
      \ not comment on litigation. \u201CThis relates to activity in 2010 and has\

      Seriously?\u201D\n\nCooper found the ads had \u201Celection-related purpose,\u201D\
      \ based on their timing and content, and met the federal definition of \u201C\
      electioneering communication.\u201D\n\nCooper said the FEC\u2019s dismissals\
      \ of the complaints ran \u201Ccontrary to law\u201D and were based on erroneous\
      \ and narrow interpretations of federal statutes governing the panel\u2019s\

      \ Listen here.\n\nWhen President Trump announced his plan to sit down for an\
      \ in-person talk with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, there was one person who was\
      \ particularly surprised by the move: Christopher R. Hill, a former U.S. diplomat\
      \ who led negotiations with North Korea in the mid-2000s.\n\nHis first reaction\
      \ to the news?\n\n\u201CWell, great skepticism, obviously,\u201D Hill said this\
      \ week. \u201CBut on the other hand, it's better than him saying, 'I have a\
      \ new idea for bombing North Korea.'\u201D\n\nOn this week's episode of \u201C\
      Can He Do That,\u201D we're talking about Trump's plans to negotiate with North\
      \ Korea \u2014 and how those plans will be shaped by the recent shake-up at\
      \ the top of the State Department. Can the president successfully navigate this\
      \ incredibly delicate diplomatic relationship?\n\nHill, the assistant secretary\
      \ of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs under President George W. Bush,\
      \ says he believes that it could be a mistake for Trump to sit down with Kim\
      \ before sending in diplomats and appointees to lay the initial groundwork.\n\
      \n\u201COnce you have had the president go in there and not succeed, I'm not\
      \ sure who else you turn to,\u201D Hill says on the podcast. \u201CSo what I\
      \ think would be a better way to proceed is to begin to have a series of discussions\
      \ with the North Koreans on what they are prepared to do to tease out what they\
      \ have apparently said about wanting to give up the nuclear program in return\
      \ for some kind of security. What do they mean there? Is there something new\
      \ there? I would think there would be.\u201D\n\n[ Trump\u2019s bellicosity secures\
      \ a diplomatic coup \u2014 for now ]\n\nKaren DeYoung, associate editor and\
      \ senior national security correspondent for The Post, agreed that Trump's strategy\
      \ on this is unconventional and demonstrates an \u201Cenormous amount of confidence\
      \ in his own ability.\u201D Previous presidents have taken a much more cautious\
      \ and methodical approach to negotiations with North Korea \u2014 but in some\
      \ ways, Trump's brisk approach might be seen as a tactical opportunity.\n\n\u201C\
      Other people have argued that, well, yes, this has gone on for many, many, many\
      \ years with North Korea, and it's basically gotten nowhere,\u201D DeYoung says.\
      \ \u201CAnd so why not? Why not just go for broke and sit down and have the\
      \ two leaders sit down, and maybe they will make some kind of big deal?\u201D\

      re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy\
      \ and timber. \u2026 And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019\
      s incredible.\u201D\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative\
      \ says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. It reports that in\
      \ 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services\
      \ than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit.\n\
      \n[ Transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks at fundraiser in Missouri on March 14\
      \ ]\n\nIn response to this story, Trump on Thursday went on Twitter to reiterate\
      \ his false assertion that the United States has a trade \u201Cdeficit\u201D\
      \ with Canada and said it was other countries that refused to accept that such\
      \ imbalances exist.\n\nWe do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with\
      \ almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada,\
      \ a very good guy, doesn\u2019t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the\
      \ U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that\u2019s how\
      \ I know! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018\n\nIn his\
      \ 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump made a blistering attack against\
      \ major U.S. allies and global economies, accusing the European Union, China,\
      \ Japan and South Korea of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging\
      \ the U.S. workforce. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement\
      \ as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing\
      \ other countries to box in the United States on trade.\n\nTrump seemed to threaten\
      \ to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn\u2019t get what he\
      \ wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said that the country had gotten rich\
      \ but that U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals. \u201CWe have a very\
      \ big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\u201D Trump said. \u201C\
      We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now\
      \ 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let\u2019s see\
      \ what happens.\u201D\n\n\u201COur allies care about themselves,\u201D he said.\
      \ \u201CThey don\u2019t care about us.\u201D\n\nTrump\u2019s comments to donors\
      \ that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show\
      \ how he might try to engage with other heads of state in the coming weeks.\
      \ Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as soon\
      \ as next week, a steep increase in duties that could affect some of the U.S.\
      \ government\u2019s biggest trading partners.\n\nTrump said countries can request\
      \ exemptions from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him.\
      \ The audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions could\
      \ prove.\n\nThe president was in Missouri to raise money for Josh Hawley, who\
      \ is taking on Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in November's midterm election. He\
      \ called McCaskill \u201Cbad for Missouri and bad for the country.\u201D But\
      \ he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about himself \u2014 bragging\
      \ about his 2016 election win and lavishing praise on himself while ticking\
      \ through a list of U.S. allies that he said are taking advantage of the United\
      \ States.\n\nThe president did not mention his abrupt firing earlier this week\
      \ of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet, the personnel turmoil engulfing\
      \ his administration, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation\
      \ of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign or reports of his\
      \ alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 and his lawyer paying\
      \ her to keep silent about the relationship.\n\nTrump spoke as his White House\
      \ tried to pick up the pieces after Democrats' apparent victory in a special\
      \ election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by\
      \ 20 points in 2016. Pollsters said the results showed how Trump was dragging\
      \ down the Republican Party, but the president took none of the blame. He said\
      \ the Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, would have lost by a wider margin\
      \ without his support \u2014 Trump held a rally for Saccone over the weekend.\
      \ And he said the Democrat, Conor Lamb, won the seat because he was \u201Clike\
      \ Trump\u201D but that Lamb would vote with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\
      \ (D-Calif.).\n\nTrump also described for donors his decision to meet with North\
      \ Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the coming months through the prism of making\
      \ history and besting his predecessors while lamenting his media coverage, questioning\
      \ U.S. allies and labeling his presidency as \u201Cvirgin territory.\u201D\n\
      \n\u201CThey couldn\u2019t have met\u201D with Kim, he said, after mocking presidents\
      \ Barack Obama and George W. Bush. \u201CNobody would have done what I did.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CIt was called appeasement: Please don\u2019t do anything,\u201D he\
      \ said of other presidents.\n\n\u201CThey say, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s not the\
      \ one to negotiate,\u2019 \u201D he said, mocking the voice of a news anchor.\
      \ \u201CHe\u2019s got very little knowledge of the Korean Peninsula. Maybe he\u2019\
      s not the one. ... Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing\
      \ games and didn\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019ve been doing for 25 years.\u201D\
      \n\nThe through lines of Trump's meandering speech were simple: Trump was tougher\
      \ than all the rest, and the United States was not going to be laughed at or\
      \ taken advantage of.\n\nHe accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto\
      \ companies access to its consumers, said South Korea was taking advantage of\
      \ outdated trade rules even though its economy was strong and said China had\
      \ single-handedly rebuilt itself on the back of its trade surplus with the United\
      \ States.\n\n\"It's called the bowling ball test; do you know what that is?\
      \ That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they\
      \ drop it on the hood of the car,\" Trump said of Japan. \"And if the hood dents,\
      \ then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit,\
      \ and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're\
      \ treated. It's horrible.\" It was unclear what he was talking about.\n\nTrump\
      \ said he didn\u2019t even want Japan to pay the tariffs but to build more automobiles\
      \ in the United States, adding that Japan would do so if tariffs were imposed.\
      \ There is no evidence of such a possibility as of now.\n\nHis comments were\
      \ among his most protectionist to date and didn\u2019t identify a single benefit\
      \ the United States receives from its trading relationships.\n\nThe \u201Cfree-trade\
      \ globalists,\u201D he said, are against his trade moves because \u201Cthey\u2019\
      re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.\u201D Gary Cohn, the president\u2019\
      s top economic adviser, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labeled\
      \ by his critics as a globalist.\n\nTrump mocked other politicians for wanting\
      \ to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement, calling Mexico \u201Cspoiled\u201D\
      \ and saying that Canada had outsmarted the United States. \u201CThe best deal\
      \ is to terminate it and make a new deal,\u201D he said.\n\nAbove all, he cast\
      \ his presidency in historic terms, saying he was attracting so much media criticism\
      \ because he was doing so well. He seemed fixated on his media coverage, even\
      \ talking about a specific CNN segment with Erin Burnett.\n\nHe said the news\
      \ media was criticizing him for \u201Cconceding\u201D a meeting with Kim.\n\n\
      \u201CThey were afraid of being blown up. Then all of a sudden, they say, let\u2019\
      s not meet,\u201D he said of reporters, referring to concerns that tensions\
      \ between the United States and North Korea are increasing the chances of a\
      \ military \u2014 and possibly nuclear \u2014 confrontation.\n\nWhile Trump\
      \ said some decry his rhetoric and think his bellicose and mercurial tendencies\
      \ could lead the United States into a war, he explained why he taunted the North\
      \ Korean president as \u201CLittle Rocket Man.\u201D He said the South Koreans\
      \ told him that Kim was agreeing to meet because of the tough U.S. sanctions\
      \ and that they promised not to conduct any nuclear tests or missile launches\
      \ until a meeting occurred. That comment could not be verified.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019\
      s going to get us in a war,\u201D he said, again mocking a news anchor. \u201C\
      You know what\u2019s going to get us in a war is weakness.\u201D\n\nHe said\
      \ Republicans needed to run on their tax bill this year, but he was determined\
      \ to not call it \u201Ctax reform,\u201D as many other Republicans have done.\
      \ He said Democrats would not appoint judges whom Republicans like while reversing\
      \ tax cuts and taking away guns, an unproven claim.\n\nHe implicitly rebuked\
      \ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for not changing the rules\
      \ of the Senate to require only 51 votes to pass any legislation, saying more\
      \ Republicans were needed because the current leadership would not act and no\
      \ one could explain why the 60-vote status quo made sense.\n\nTrump criticized\
      \ judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, saying his presidency\
      \ would reshape the judiciary and change courts such as that one. He said he\
      \ planned to pick 145 judges and thanked Obama for leaving so many vacancies.\n\
      \nAt the end of the day, the event, as it usually is with Trump, was about marketing.\
      \ He said Republicans needed to run on tax cuts because they were very \u201C\
      popular.\u201D\n\n\u201CDo me a favor: Don\u2019t call it tax reform. It hasn\u2019\
      t worked in 45 years,\u201D Trump said he told others. \u201CYou say you\u2019\
      re reforming taxes, that means taxes could go up.\u201D\n\n\u201CI actually\
      \ said, \u2018Let\u2019s call it the Tax Cut Cut Cut plan,\u2019 \u201D Trump\
      \ said. \u201CI actually did.\u201D\n\nHe added: \u201CThey thought it sounded\
      \ a little hokey, so we called it the tax cut and jobs plan. I liked the first\
      \ one better.\u201D\n\nThis story has been updated."

      \ [Unintelligible.] Dennis is doing a good job. But we were just looking at\
      \ some of the new planes without pilots, now. I mean, you know, look at them.\
      \ I'm saying, \u201CWhat about that one?\u201D It has no cockpit.\n\nDennis,\
      \ tell me, what's going on?\n\nHe said, \u201CWell, this plane doesn't have\
      \ a pilot.\u201D This is where we're going, I guess. But, what a job they're\
      \ doing. I want to thank a great friend of mine Congressman Jason Smith. He's\
      \ here someplace, where is Jason?\n\nFirst off we have a situation so important\
      \ here. That's why I'm here. I'm here for this [unintelligible] big success,\
      \ from what I understand. A [unintelligible] success. That's a big success,\
      \ isn't it? [Applause.]\n\nReally. It's a testament to a wonderful guy who's\
      \ running who knows what it's all about. He's somebody that can win. He's leading\
      \ the polls, just about every poll I've seen. But there was one that was a little\
      \ bit down. And that's the one you have to run on because you always have to\
      \ run a little bit scared, right, a little bit scared. But then I saw fortunately\
      \ the following week it kicked back up, I got a little nervous. [Laughter.]\
      \ But you're doing good, and I tell ya, every one of them. And, you're the one\
      \ that can do it. And the whole the whole world is watching, really, we have\
      \ to change things. And we need, we need those votes. We need the votes. You'll\
      \ work on the filibuster once you get in there, right? I know that. Does anybody\
      \ know what that means? Wouldn't it be nice if we had 51 instead of 60? Wouldn't\
      \ that be nice?\n\nSome day somebody's going to explain that do me. What's going\
      \ on here?\n\nBut that's it. Some of the senators have been there, really, for\
      \ a long time are just dead set on that. But we're gonna get \u2014 we have\
      \ a chance to win a number of seats. And I think we have a really good chance\
      \ to win a large number of seats, so we'll see what happens. Mr. Ashcroft, where\
      \ is Mr. Ashcroft? I didn't see him. I met your son, by the way. [Unintelligible.]\
      \ [Applause.] I met John's son.\n\nI said, \u201CHey, where's your father?\u201D\
      \ He said, \u201CHe's up speaking,\u201D I said, \u201COh, okay. So, maybe I'll\
      \ see him outside.\u201D You're a terrific man, terrific family.\n\nBut we have\
      \ a chance to do something that's going to be very important and it starts right\
      \ here, it starts right here. And you know, last night, I don't know I guess\
      \ the final results aren't quite in, we had an interesting time because we lifted\
      \ seven points up that's a lot. And I was up 22 points, and we lifted seven\
      \ and seven normally would be enough, but we'll see. We'll see how it all comes\
      \ out. It's like virtually a tie.\n\nWhere's our great Ronna, is she here?\n\
      \nRonna McDaniel, who ran Michigan for me. And we won the state of Michigan,\
      \ first time since Reagan. [Unintelligible.] [Applause] Two hundred and some\
      \ odd thousand votes and it was a difference of four hundred and something,\
      \ right? Four hundred and something votes. And I don't know what's going to\
      \ happen but I know he came up a lot in the last few days. We went there, we\
      \ read his speech, the place was packed, and we'll see what happens. It's actually\
      \ interesting because it's only a congressman for about five months. I don't\
      \ know about that one, Josh, it's a lot of work for five months. They changed\
      \ the district, they're redistricting.\n\nBut we'll see what happens. But I\
      \ told Josh just a little while ago, I'm coming back here just before the race\
      \ and we'll get, get a bigger [unintelligible] and get a big something, and\
      \ we'll do a job. [Unintelligible.] [Applause.]\n\nThe country is watching.\
      \ This is one of the most important races because this is one that we can win\
      \ because of Josh, we had to get Josh to do it. Once that was it just we haven't\
      \ ingested. Once that was [unintelligible], that was a big thing. Because you\
      \ do need the right candidate, and we have a few of them, we have a few pretty\
      \ good ones. You know about what's happening. A couple of other guys joined\
      \ and they are going to have great success. So we look forward to \u2014 One\
      \ of the things that we, that Josh actually mentioned that I think is probably\
      \ underscored understated but very important is judges.\n\nWe are going to be\
      \ appointing 145, came in 140 \u2014 you know, my whole life I've helped a few\
      \ people become a federal judge. Not gotten it for them, but I helped and they\
      \ never forget. It's a big deal. A federal judge.\n\nSo I come and there's this\
      \ whole pile of papers on my desk \u2014 these are federal judges, these are\
      \ applications. I said, \u201CHow many do we appoint?\u201D \"145.\u201D \"\
      145!\u201D Because for two years, two and a half years, almost none were appointed\
      \ by President Obama. So I say thank you, President Obama. [Applause]\n\nWell,\
      \ we have 17 court of appeals judges. We had one Supreme Court judge who's done\
      \ a fantastic job, Justice Gorsuch. And we'll see what happens on that score,\
      \ but we have 145 judges and 17 court of appeals judges and we've appointed\
      \ \u2014 I guess we've had almost 30 approved already. And what difference that's\
      \ making. That'll be almost half of the judiciary will be appointed by us. [Unintelligible.]\
      \ [Applause.]\n\nI mentioned before, we have to run on the tax cuts because\
      \ that has become the most popular thing. Everybody's happy, the companies kicked\
      \ in like crazy you know. The companies \u2014 we didn't expect, when we did\
      \ the tax cuts and you know they called it tax reform. I said, \u201CDo me a\
      \ favor, don't call it tax reform, hasn't worked in 45 years, right?\u201D Tax\
      \ reform! People saying, \u201CAre you going to raise my taxes? They're reforming\
      \ taxes!\u201D I said that means taxes to go up, and they said well, no, but\
      \ it's always called tax reform, I said, let's call it tax cuts. In fact, I\
      \ said, they said what would you like to call it? Call it the tax cut cut cut\
      \ plan. [Applause.] They thought it sounded a little hokey, so we called it\
      \ the tax cut and jobs plan.\n\nI liked the first one better.\n\nWe had no Democrat\
      \ votes. Claire McCaskill was against it because she's party line. It's not\
      \ that she's was against it. She's party line. She's going to go with the party\
      \ line. It's like the young man last night that ran, he said, oh, I'm like Trump.\
      \ He said, I, I, you know, Second Amendment, all, everything. I love the tax\
      \ cuts. Everything. You wouldn't have known. It's a pretty smart race, actually.\
      \ But he ran and he ran on that basis. But the bottom line is when he votes,\
      \ he's going to vote with Nancy Pelosi. He's going to vote with Pelosi, he's\
      \ going to vote with Schumer, and that's what's going to happen. And there's\
      \ nothing he can do about it, he's not going to vote with the Republicans. So\
      \ it doesn't matter, what he feels doesn't matter. Claire McCaskill has voted\
      \ against everything that we want. Voted against everything that you stand for,\
      \ and voted against these massive tax cuts that are bringing wealth back into\
      \ families and bringing wealth into the state of Missouri and every other state.\
      \ And she voted against, because this wasn't principle. This was the fact that\
      \ she was told to vote that way, and she has to vote that way. And if she didn't\
      \ vote that way, the party would drop her very easily and wouldn't be around\
      \ and wouldn't be spending lots of money on her and that's the way it is. So\
      \ she voted against tax cuts and I believe that anybody that voted against that\
      \ bill, I think it would be very hard to win an election.\n\nSo I think when\
      \ you campaign when you're out there Josh, you should just keep bringing it\
      \ up, she voted against. And I read an article and I thought it was very nice,\
      \ actually. She said she said she's not going to say bad things about President\
      \ Trump, I said, boy, I must be very popular in that state.\n\nAnd last night,\
      \ the young man also, he ran on a campaign, he said very nice things about me.\
      \ I kept saying, is he a Republican? He sounded like a Republican to me. But\
      \ I guess when you're popular in a certain area, that's probably a good tactic.\
      \ But we're not going to get her vote. So you have to defeat her. You have to\
      \ defeat her. And if you don't, it's just going to be Trump. I mean, they could\
      \ actually take away the tax cuts, they could take away your Second Amendment.\
      \ Very importantly, judges, they'll start putting the judges that we've been\
      \ having poured onto the court over the last eight years. You can't take it.\
      \ I mean you just can't have it. You see some of the decisions. How about the\
      \ Ninth Circuit? Anytime you go. They always file in the Ninth Circuit, which\
      \ says something \u2014 look that's not right. No matter where they're sued,\
      \ they file in the Ninth Circuit. And they win, win, win and then they lose,\
      \ usually the Supreme Court, hopefully they will. But it's you know it's a very\
      \ unfair thing, it shows you how important it is to have fair people put on\
      \ the bench.\n\nSo the judges are so important, I mean just so important. We're\
      \ doing a lot of things. Companies are moving back into our country. Chrysler\
      \ that's coming back from Mexico, you [unintelligible] hear that one? It's always\
      \ they're leaving from Mexico, someone's leaving from Mexico, they're always\
      \ leaving for Mexico. And now, you have many, many companies coming back in,\
      \ you have steel mills opening up, which hasn't happened in 30 years. And the\
      \ tariffs are just a form of, like, you just can't keep doing this to the outside\
      \ world. And some of our worst abusers in terms of what they do on trade our\
      \ so-called friends. You look in some of these countries that are our friends\
      \ and you look at the trade deficits we have and it's, it's staggering. So that's\
      \ just Phase One, but that's a little phase, but we have to get back the respect.\
      \ You know we built ourselves as a great power, a great manufacturing power.\
      \ And then you look how so many jobs was taken. I mean NAFTA has been a disaster\
      \ for this country. And I know it affected your [unintelligible], but you go\
      \ up to New England, and they're still paying the price of losing all of those\
      \ jobs. And those are real jobs. Those are real, incredible, powerful, important\
      \ jobs \u2014 even for defense. We have to be able to make steel. We have to\
      \ be able to have aluminum. We were at a point where we were going to lose all\
      \ our steel factories, our steel mills, our plants, and we can't let that happen.\
      \ People said you know it's sort of \u2014 oh, we'll get our steel from China.\
      \ Oh good. Let's see if we can, we have a national emergency. We're gonna get\
      \ our steel from China. It's incredible.\n\nI've been using the expression,\
      \ if you don't have steel you don't have a country. There's a lot to it. This\
      \ is like we're making pencils. This is big stuff.\n\nSo since I announced this\
      \ we've had numerous openings of plants and you have some that are going to\
      \ open up or expand right here, and we've had a lot of, I mean, people are [unintelligible]\
      \ to see a little bit differently. But we have to do what's called reciprocal\
      \ tax, because we have countries that charge us 25 percent to get a car and\
      \ they don't take the car anyway. Just so you know.\n\nThey have nondollar barriers.\
      \ okay, they're nondollar. You know what the barrier says? You can't sell in\
      \ our country. That's worse than heavy taxes. So we have countries and groups\
      \ of countries, which is even worse.\n\nEuropean Union is very tough. You know,\
      \ we had the European Union \u2014 a lot of you came from Europe, right? Guess\
      \ what. They're pretty smart. And they formed a group, and they make it very\
      \ difficult, they're very difficult traders. They have these barriers where\
      \ you can't get your product in. No matter what you do, if you do get your product\
      \ in, you pay dearly. China would be the biggest abuser. There's no question\
      \ about it.\n\nSo last year with China, we lost 500 billion dollars, would you\
      \ say that? Not million, 500 million, that's a lot.\n\n500 billion dollars.\
      \ And it's been that way for years, from 200 to 504 billion dollars, every year.\
      \ We rebuilt China, we actually did. You take that money away from China.\n\n\
      I mean we rebuilt it, and it all started with the World Trade Organization.\
      \ If you look at China, it's like this for many, many centuries.\n\nWorld trade,\
      \ it's like a rocket ship, and much of it came right out of this country, got\
      \ to stop it. And I'm very friendly with the president, he's a great guy. We\
      \ have a great chemistry, a great relationship. But he's for China and I'm for\
      \ the good old USA. [Applause.]\n\nAs an example, they send a car to us, we\
      \ charge them a 2 percent tax. We send a car to them, and they charge us a 25\
      \ percent tax.\n\nSomehow that doesn't work too well.\n\nThat's not a great\
      \ formula. But not only is it 25, 25, but most of the time you can't even get\
      \ the car. Even Japan. Look, the prime minister's a great guy, Abe. He's a warrior.\
      \ Tough, strong, smart. But I said trade isn't so good with Japan. It's so one-sided.\
      \ They don't take our product and we take their cars, I mean the cars and 90\
      \ percent of the cars, they just come. They need Mario Andretti to drive those\
      \ cars off the boats. They come off the boats like 60 miles an hour. We send\
      \ a car to Japan, they analyze it for four weeks before they decide to send\
      \ it back because it's not environmentally friendly. [Unintelligible.] They\
      \ actually, one of the car companies actually had a car made and it was the\
      \ most environmentally perfect car, cost them a fortune. They spent a fortune.\
      \ And they had everything, the highest quality that you can have. Everything\
      \ was far better than any car they ever sent to us. They spent three or four\
      \ hundred thousand dollars for a car that would sell for like 35,000, right?\
      \ Not a good deal. But they wanted to see if they could get it in. And it, they\
      \ were going crazy. Four days went by. Then five days. And they were ready to\
      \ approve it and they said, no no, we have to do one more test. It's called\
      \ the bowling ball test, do you know what that is? That's where they take a\
      \ bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the\
      \ car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what,\
      \ the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify.\
      \ It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible.\n\nAnd then you hear\
      \ about the free traders, because I'm a free trader, but I'm like, I want to\
      \ be a smart trader, I want to be a fair trader. It's so unfair what's happened\
      \ to our country, and I don't know, the politicians have lost their way. In\
      \ some cases like South Korea you know they're making a fortune. Well we backed\
      \ them many years ago.\n\nBut we never trade \u2014 you know when they became\
      \ rich we never changed the deal. So we were backing, backing, backing. And\
      \ no politician ever changed the deal.\n\nNow we have a very big trade deficit\
      \ with them, and we protect them. So we lose money on trade, and we lose money\
      \ on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North\
      \ and South Korea.\n\nLet's see what happens. Think I've done a good job with\
      \ that one. That's sort of interesting.\n\nPeople are saying, \"oh, his rhetoric\
      \ is terrible. He's going to go\" \u2014 well, the rhetoric from last 30 years\
      \ hasn't been so good. It was called appeasement.\n\nPlease don't do anything.\
      \ Obama, let's not talk about that. In the meantime, he's making nuclear weapons.\
      \ He had a test, they had a test of a nuclear weapon about a year ago, and it\
      \ registered as an 8.6. Now, you heard of that, on the Richter scale, right?\
      \ So they said, \"man, there was an earthquake.\" Eight point six someplace\
      \ in Asia. Where was it? Oh it was in North Korea. It wasn't \u2014 it was a\
      \ nuclear test, and it shifted a mountain \u2014 it was a real mountain. This\
      \ isn't like a little, you know, 10-foot deal. It's not a hill. And it actually\
      \ shifted. That's the power. So they're all saying, his rhetoric is terrible\
      \ and so tough. Little Rocket Man, you know all this stuff. It's so terrible.\
      \ He's going to get us into a war. Well, you know what's going to get us into\
      \ a war is weakness. [Applause.] [Unintelligible.] Massive sanctions on North\
      \ Korea.\n\nMassive, like nobody's ever been sanctioned. And in all fairness,\
      \ China has really helped at the border. They could help more, but they've done\
      \ more for us than they've done for any president, that I can tell you.\n\n\
      So here's a funny subject \u2014 everybody's saying, oh, he's going to get us\
      \ in trouble, in trouble. Then three weeks ago, you hear, we'd love to go to\
      \ the Olympics and participate.\n\nEverybody's like, what? Where did that come\
      \ from? So they participate in the Olympics, that's nice. Then the delegation\
      \ comes over from South Korea and they just left North Korea, and they said\
      \ Mr. President, Kim Jong Un would love to meet with you. And he will not do\
      \ any testing and he will not do missile launches and he would love to meet\
      \ with you. I said really? Well. That's good. I said how did that happen. And\
      \ he said well, you're having an impact. They go out to the press, and the press\
      \ is there, they were \u2014 you never saw so many reporters. Because they heard\
      \ there was a big announcement on North Korea. So the worst, like CNN, you know,\
      \ fake news?\n\nErin Burnett said this could make him a great president. [Applause.]\
      \ Right? She said it. She'll probably lose her job.\n\nBut she actually said\
      \ that \u2014 this could make him a great president. Even the worst \u2014 for\
      \ two hours, three hours they couldn't believe. They said, did you hear what\
      \ ha \u2014 they're looking at each other. Can you believe? Where did this come\
      \ from, after 25, 30 years, where did this come from?\n\nYou believe what just\
      \ come from after 25, 30 years from. And then it happened. A day later, \u201C\
      Obama could have done that, too.\u201D Obama could not have done it. [\u201C\
      No way,\u201D crowd replies.]\n\nIt's really, you know, it's really sad. Now,\
      \ it was almost, you had to smile, because it's so out of control. But what\
      \ I heard \u2014 and I woke up the next morning and said, finally I'm getting\
      \ some great stuff \u2014 because got things, the taxes, the this, they were\
      \ \u2014 a lot of stuff.\n\nOur military's stronger now, and we just got 700\
      \ billion dollars. We have to build it because it's totally depleted. We don't\
      \ have our military, we're not going to be here. We'll be walking into the doors.\
      \ [Unintelligible.] [Applause.] It's jobs.\n\nWe make the greatest equipment\
      \ in the world right down the street with Boeing and other places. And it's\
      \ jobs. But we have no choice. But when I heard that, I said, I wake up and\
      \ I just heard the greatest statements from MSNBC, from CNN, from all the haters.\
      \ I hear these \u2014 they couldn't believe it.\n\nReporters. Professionals.\
      \ The ones you see hating all the time. I say, this is the most incredible thing,\
      \ we've never seen anything like it.\n\nBut by the time you woke up the next\
      \ morning, they had a new line: Anybody could've done it. Obama could have met.\
      \ Bush could have met. I don't know how many Bush fans are in here. But Bush\
      \ could have \u2014 [Laughter.] But they couldn't have met. Because nobody would've\
      \ done what I did to set the table.\n\nAnd this suffering, I don't want them\
      \ to suffer. But they're suffering. Lack of food, lack of everything. Nobody\
      \ would've done that.\n\nSo you see the narrative change, because now they're\
      \ saying it will take at least two months to be able to negotiate. And so these\
      \ are the people who say you will take two months to be able to negotiate. He\
      \ shouldn't go there. And the greatest line is, President Trump has agreed to\
      \ meet \u2014 these are people who say I can't believe it. Unbelievable. This\
      \ is great news. This is the biggest thing that's happened in 40 years. The\
      \ next day: President Trump has conceded a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Because\
      \ he has met, he has already given them a victory because he's agreed to meet.\
      \ I mean [unintelligible] media, right? [Applause.] The greatest is when, you\
      \ know, you're watching them, and these are the people who were so afraid it\
      \ was going to be \u2014 and then they say, and they say it was incredible and\
      \ then they get back and their bosses tell them what to say. But they say maybe\
      \ he's not the one to negotiate.\n\nHe's got, he's got very little knowledge\
      \ of the Korean Peninsula, and maybe he's not the one. Maybe we should send\
      \ in the people that have been playing games and didn\u2019t know what the hell\
      \ they\u2019ve been doing for 25 years. [Applause.] [Unintelligible.] What we're\
      \ finding there, and I don't know if you are now, is, it's a beautiful young,\
      \ beautiful couple that everybody thinks is a star, and he is a star, and I\
      \ don't know how the press treats you. [Unintelligible.] [Laughter.] Enjoy it\
      \ while you can.\n\nThe better you do, the worse they'll [unintelligible.] And\
      \ I tell this Korea story because it was, it was somewhat of a miracle. It's\
      \ actually far ahead of schedule. And you know, you hear that we're making a\
      \ major concession by agreeing to the meeting, you know, it's the craziest thing.\
      \ But go back a couple of weeks earlier and listen to what \u2014 they were\
      \ petrified. [Unintelligible.] They were afraid of being blown up. Then all\
      \ of a sudden they say let's not meet.\n\nSo we are always a little bit of a\
      \ disadvantage because of the media, and you have it here, I know you have it\
      \ here too. But the advantage we have is the people are really smart. When I\
      \ did the tariffs \u2014 and basically what I'm really saying, it's not so much\
      \ tariffs, it's really saying we can't be taking advantage of anymore by these\
      \ people that come in and dump everything into our country and destroy our mills\
      \ and destroy our workers and destroy everything. So when I did the tariffs,\
      \ most people understand what I'm doing is fighting for them, I'm fighting for\
      \ these companies that are being abandoned and the jobs that are being abandoned.\n\
      \nAnd that's why we have a lot of companies moving back in.\n\nI mean seriously,\
      \ when you see what's happening you look \u2014 we're renegotiating NAFTA right\
      \ now. I don't know that we can make it good.\n\nI tell people openly, because\
      \ the best deal is to terminate it and then make a new deal. But I don't know\
      \ that we can make a deal because Mexico is so spoiled with this horrible deal\
      \ that they've lived with, from our standpoint horrible.\n\nSo think of it,\
      \ Mexico makes more than a hundred billion dollars a year on the United States.\
      \ Now, how stupid is this.\n\nBut sometimes something is so good that you can't\
      \ \u2014 how do you? The best way? Terminate, let's start all over again. Let's\
      \ start all over again. But some of the politicians are afraid to terminate,\
      \ oh, we don't want to terminate NAFTA. Take a look at these empty mills all\
      \ over the place, that they turn into nursing homes, you know. Nice solid walls\
      \ on the outside. But, it's \u2014 it just can't be.\n\nI really think we're\
      \ making the point a lot of people are digging it. I will tell you, the people\
      \ that really count, which is you, the workers, everybody, they're really understanding\
      \ what's going on. Nobody's done what I'm doing. I mean it's sort of really\
      \ virgin territory.\n\nIt's absolutely virgin territory. It's territory that\
      \ our country for 50 or 60 or 70 years has not wanted to go there. They just\
      \ haven't for whatever reason.\n\nAnd our wealth has been taken, our jobs have\
      \ been taken, our companies have moved, and now they're starting to move back.\
      \ So it's, it's a formula that is, it's just absolute \u2014 there's disruption,\
      \ there's anger. And just remember, our friends that everybody says \u2014 our\
      \ allies, our allies are wonderful \u2014 I love our allies. Our allies care\
      \ about themselves, they don't care about us. You look at our trade deficit\
      \ with these countries are our allies. It's unbelievable. And they understand\
      \ it. I don't blame them.\n\nI told Japan \u2014 so we lose 100 billion dollars\
      \ a year with Japan \u2014 100 billion. So why aren't we taxing their cars when\
      \ they come in. Then we'd lose nothing. We might even make something. And you\
      \ know what they're going to do, they're going to say we don't want to pay that\
      \ tax, so let's build plants in the United States. They already have some. But\
      \ they'll expand them and they'll build new plants. Because they don't want\
      \ to pay the tax \u2014 I want them to build new plants in the United States.\
      \ Let them make United States here \u2014 like China makes them do, we have\
      \ a company, they want to build planes over there, hate to say it, Boeing is\
      \ being forced to build plants. I don't like that, I don't like it, so I'm not\
      \ saying China's wrong. I was with President Xi, I was with a big group of people,\
      \ and I was saying how China is ripping off the United States. And he's like\
      \ \"woo, this is uncomfortable.\" [Laughter.] 700 press. I'm saying China is\
      \ ripping off our \u2014 but I don't blame you. I say, it's great that you were\
      \ able to do it for yourselves. I blame the people that represented our country,\
      \ because they were not doing their job \u2014 they were delinquent in allowing\
      \ this to happen to us. So we owe 21 trillion dollars. We lose 800 billion a\
      \ year.\n\nJosh will say, I don't think I'm going to ruin [unintelligible.]\
      \ Think of it, Josh. We lose 800 billion a year on trade. Who made these deals?\
      \ Who made these deals?\n\nThen you have certain people that think it's okay\
      \ to lose 800. You know, these worldly people. You know why they're worldly\
      \ people, because they have stuff on the other side. [Laughter.] That's what\
      \ it is. Can't be any other reason. But we lose 800 billion dollars a year on\
      \ trade. We lose our jobs, we lose everything.\n\nAnd it's not happening anymore,\
      \ because it's starting to come back. But over the next few months, you're going\
      \ to find it even more interesting. Because things are really \u2014 you know,\
      \ we have, statutorily you have to do this, this, this, wait 90 days, wait six\
      \ months, you can't do it, you're not allowed to legally. We have agreements\
      \ that are so bad.\n\nWe have one agreement with a trade. I said when does that\
      \ agreement terminate, it's terrible. Sir, there is no termination. I said,\
      \ what do you mean? We don't have the right to term \u2014 I said, well, okay,\
      \ after 10 years, 20 years. No sir, there is no right of term \u2014 I said\
      \ what the hell kind of \u2014 So you know what I did, I just terminated. [Applause.]\n\
      \nWhich would mean that's, we'll call it unconstitutional. There's no end date.\
      \ There's no nothing. I'll give you another example, Mexico, so they have this\
      \ great deal. The day it was signed, it was a bad deal, because they have a\
      \ 16 percent VAT tax, and we don't. So they were already up 16 percent before\
      \ the deal. And nobody saw that. And by the time they realized it, the deal\
      \ was gone. But instead of adjusting the deal \u2014 what was that, 30 years\
      \ ago when it was first signed \u2014 instead of adjusting the deal, we lived\
      \ with it. What the hell difference does it make?\n\nSo they had a 16 percent\
      \ step up advantage on us, and they have for many years. And Mexico and Canada\
      \ \u2014 and, by the way, Canada, they negotiate tougher than Mexico. Trudeau\
      \ came to see me, he's a good guy, Justin. He said, no, no, we have no trade\
      \ deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please. Nice guy, good-looking, comes\
      \ in \u2014 Donald, we have no trade deficit \u2014 he was very proud, because\
      \ everybody else you know were getting killed with our, so he's [unintelligible].\
      \ I said wrong, Justin, you do. I didn't even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just\
      \ said, you're wrong. You know why? Because we're so stupid. [Unintelligible,\
      \ laughter] And I thought they were smart.\n\nI said you're wrong, Justin. He\
      \ said, Nope, we have no trade deficit. I said, Well, in that case, I feel differently,\
      \ I said, but I don\u2019t believe it. I sent one of our guys out, his guy,\
      \ my guy, they went out, I said, Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\
      Well sir you're actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn't include\
      \ energy and timber. But when you do we lose 17 billion dollars a year. It's\
      \ incredible. So you're in good hands. And I need Josh to help [unintelligible].\
      \ [Applause.]\n\nClaire McCaskill is a guaranteed negative vote on every single\
      \ thing that you people stand for, and frankly that a vast majority of the people\
      \ of Missouri stand for. It is a negative vote for our country. And you have\
      \ to defeat Claire McCaskill. Last time she get very lucky. She got lucky \u2014\
      \ she was going to lose. That was a done deal. And then, something happened.\
      \ I was watching, I said, oh! What happened. That was big! The next day I said,\
      \ oh yeah, I was right, I watched that.\n\nSo you got to get her out. Bad for\
      \ Missouri, bad for the country. And this is going to be a great United States\

    text: "Outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivered a statement to reporters\
      \ at the State Department after President Trump fired him Tuesday. Absent in\
      \ his speech were remarks about Trump\u2019s \u201CAmerica First\u201D strategy\
      \ or any comments about the president. Instead, Tillerson thanked State Department\
      \ employees for their work regarding North Korea and stressed the importance\
      \ of allies and partners.\n\nHere is what he said:\n\nAfternoon all. I received\
      \ a call today from the president of the United States a little after noon time\
      \ from Air Force One, and I've also spoken to White House Chief of Staff [John\
      \ F.] Kelly to ensure we have clarity as to the days ahead. What is most important\
      \ is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country\
      \ continues to face significant policy and national security challenges. As\
      \ such, effective at the end of the day, I'm delegating all responsibilities\
      \ of the Office of the Secretary to Deputy Secretary of State [John J.] Sullivan.\
      \ My commission as secretary of state will terminate at midnight, March 31.\n\
      \nBetween now and then, I will address a few administrative matters related\
      \ to my departure and work towards a smooth and orderly transition for Secretary\
      \ of State-designate Mike Pompeo. I\u2019m encouraging my policy planning team\
      \ and undersecretaries and assistant secretaries, those confirmed, as well as\
      \ those in acting positions, to remain at their post and continue our mission\
      \ at the State Department and working with the interagency process. I will be\
      \ meeting members of my front office team and policy planning later today to\
      \ thank them for their service. They have been extraordinarily dedicated to\
      \ our mission, which includes promoting values that I view as being very important\
      \ to the safety and security of our State Department personnel: accountability,\
      \ which means treating each other with honesty and integrity, and respect for\
      \ one another. Most recently, in particular, to address challenges of sexual\
      \ harassment within the department.\n\nI want to speak now to my State Department\
      \ colleagues and to our interagency colleagues and partners at DOD and the Joint\
      \ Chiefs of Staff, most particularly, to my Foreign Service officers and civil\
      \ service colleagues. We all take the same oath of office, whether you\u2019\
      re a career employee or a political appointee, we are all bound by that common\
      \ commitment to support and defend the Constitution, to bear true faith and\
      \ allegiance to the same, and to faithfully discharge the duties of our office.\
      \ As a State Department, we are bound together by that oath. We remain steadfast\
      \ here in Washington and in posts across the world, many of whom are in danger-placed\
      \ situations without their families. The world needs selfless leaders like these:\
      \ ready to work with long-standing allies, new emerging partners and allies,\
      \ who now, many are struggling as democracies, and in some cases are dealing\
      \ with human tragedy, crisis of natural disasters \u2014 literally crawling\
      \ themselves out of those circumstances. These are experiences that no lecture\
      \ hall in an academic environment or a think tank can teach you. Only by people\
      \ going to the front lines to serve can they develop this kind of talent. To\
      \ the men and women in uniform, I\u2019m told for the first time in most people\u2019\
      s memory the Department of State and Department of Defense have a close working\
      \ relationship where we all agree the U.S. leadership starts with diplomacy.\
      \ The men and women in uniform at the Department of Defense and the leadership\
      \ of Secretary [of Defense Jim] Mattis and Gen. [Joseph F.] Dunford protect\
      \ us as Americans and our way of life daily, at home and abroad. As an all-volunteer\
      \ military, they do it for the love of country, they do it for you, and they\
      \ do it for me \u2014 and for no other reason. As Americans, we are all eternally\
      \ grateful to each of them, and we honor their sacrifices.\n\nThe rewarding\
      \ part of having leadership and partnerships in place is that you can actually\
      \ get some things done, and I want to give recognition to the State Department\
      \ and our partners for a few of their accomplishments under this administration.\
      \ First, working with allies, we exceeded the expectations of almost everyone\
      \ with the DPRK maximum pressure campaign with the announcement on my very first\
      \ trip as secretary of state to the region that the era of strategic patience\
      \ was over, and we commenced the steps to dramatically increase not just the\
      \ scope but the effectiveness of the sanctions. The department undertook a global\
      \ campaign to bring partners and allies on board in every country around the\
      \ world with every embassy and mission raising this to the highest levels, and\
      \ in every meeting I\u2019ve had throughout the year, this has been on the agenda\
      \ to discuss: the adoption of the South Asia strategy, with a conditions-based\
      \ military plan as the tool to compel the Taliban to reconciliation and peace\
      \ talks with the Afghan government, finally equipped our military planners with\
      \ a strategy which they can execute as opposed to a succession of 16 one-year\
      \ strategies. This clear military commitment attracted the support of allies\
      \ broadly and equipped our diplomats with a whole new level of certainty around\
      \ how to prepare for the peace talks and achieve the final objectives.\n\nIn\
      \ other areas where progress has been made, much work remains. In Syria, we\
      \ did achieve important cease-fires and stabilizations which we know has saved\
      \ thousands of lives. There\u2019s more to be done in Syria, particularly with\
      \ respect to achieving the peace, as well as stabilizing Iraq, and seeing a\
      \ healthy government installed more broadly in the entire global campaign to\
      \ defeat ISIS. Nothing is possible without allies and partners, though. Much\
      \ work remains to establish a clear view of the nature of our future relationship\
      \ with China. How should we deal with one another over the next 50 years and\
      \ ensure a period of prosperity for all of our peoples, free of conflict between\
      \ two very powerful nations? And much work remains to respond to the troubling\
      \ behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government. Russia must assess\
      \ carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people\
      \ and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely\
      \ to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone\u2019\
      s interest.\n\nSo to my colleagues in the State Department and the interagency:\
      \ Much remains to be done to achieve our mission on behalf of the American people,\
      \ with allies and with partners. I close by thanking all for the privilege of\
      \ serving beside you for the last 14 months. Importantly, to the 300-plus million\
      \ Americans: Thank you for your devotion to a free and open society, to acts\
      \ of kindness towards one another, to honesty and the quiet hard work that you\
      \ do every day to support this government with your tax dollars. All of us,\
      \ we know, want to leave this place as a better place for the next generation.\
      \ I now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud\
      \ of the opportunity I\u2019ve had to serve my country.\n\nGod bless all of\
      \ you. God bless the American people. God bless America.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn\

      \ General Xavier Becerra (D), responds to remarks made last week during a visit\
      \ to California by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\n\
      SAN DIEGO \u2014 On the eve of President Trump\u2019s first visit to California\
      \ since taking office, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, is\
      \ questioning Trump\u2019s decision to highlight prototypes for his promised\
      \ U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n\u201CYou see, in California we are focusing on\
      \ bridges, not walls,\u201D Brown writes in a letter to Trump that Brown\u2019\
      s office released Monday morning.\n\nIn the letter, Brown encourages Trump to\
      \ visit the state\u2019s Central Valley, where preparations are underway for\
      \ a bullet train from San Francisco to Los Angeles \u2014 including the construction\
      \ of bridges to accommodate the high-speed line \u2014 and touts the diversity\
      \ of a state that on its own is the sixth largest economy in the world.\n\n\u201C\
      California thrives because we welcome immigrants and innovators from across\
      \ the globe,\u201D Brown says in the letter, in which he also says that \u201C\
      our prosperity is not built on isolation.\u201D\n\n[ Trump pushes back on chief\
      \ of staff\u2019s claims that border wall pledges are \u2018uninformed\u2019\
      \ ]\n\nUpon arriving in the nation\u2019s most populous state on Tuesday, Trump\
      \ plans to visit the site near here of eight border-wall prototypes that are\
      \ being tested by the Department of Homeland Security. The prototypes are a\
      \ key early step toward fulfilling Trump\u2019s marquee campaign promise.\n\n\
      He is also scheduled to give an address here to military members at the Marine\
      \ Corps Air Station Miramar and attend a Republican fundraiser in Beverly Hills.\n\
      \nIn his letter, Brown notes that other presidents have used their inaugural\
      \ visits to California to celebrate diversity.\n\nBrown cites the visits of\
      \ President Harry S. Truman, who in 1945 witnessed the signing of the U.N. charter\
      \ in San Francisco, and of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who in 1964 met with\
      \ the president of Mexico.\n\nLast month, Mexican President Enrique Pe\xF1a\
      \ Nieto scrapped plans to make his first visit to the White House to meet with\
      \ Trump after a testy phone call between the two leaders ended in an impasse\
      \ over Trump\u2019s promised border wall.\n\nBrown also notes in his letter\
      \ that during his first visit to California, President George W. Bush acknowledged\
      \ the importance of California to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201CFor decades,\
      \ California has been the place where the future happens first,\u201D Bush said.\
      \ \u201CYour continuing success is essential to the continuing success of the\
      \ U.S. economy.\u201D\n\nBrown accused the Trump administration last week of\
      \ being \u201Cat war\u201D with California after it filed a lawsuit against\
      \ the state targeting its \u201Csanctuary city\u201D laws meant to protect undocumented\
      \ immigrants.\n\nAlso in anticipation of Trump\u2019s visit, California Attorney\
      \ General Xavier Becerra (D) is scheduled to hold a conference call with reporters\
      \ Monday to talk about what he thinks should be the focus of the president\u2019\
      s visit.\n\nBecerra has filed 28 lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking\
      \ to block an array of federal initiatives, including the border wall."

      \ day in the White House \u2014 represents the opening salvo in what could be\
      \ the most concerted effort to overhaul the federal workforce in 35 years.\u201D\
      \n\nA year and two months later, the administration continues its efforts to\
      \ downsize the government. Its proposed budget plan, released last month, includes\
      \ dramatic cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department.\
      \ But so far, the game-changing overhaul hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nWhat\u2019\
      s the holdup?\n\n[ Trump has long vowed to slash government. Now the knives\
      \ are finally coming out. ]\n\n\u201CI think that there\u2019s fundamental confusion\
      \ among both the general public, but even people who work in the government,\
      \ about how the federal budget process works,\u201D says Romina Boccia of the\
      \ Heritage Foundation in this week\u2019s episode of \u201CCan He Do That?\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CPeople tend to get very scared when the president\u2019s budget comes\
      \ out, but they pay much less attention to the congressional budgets \u2014\
      \ even though those are much more important,\u201D Boccia adds. \u201CAnd in\
      \ the United States, it\u2019s the president\u2019s budget that\u2019s really\
      \ the least relevant of all of the budgets.\u201D\n\nThis week\u2019s episode\
      \ of the podcast takes a look at the appropriations process, and why, for the\
      \ first time since the beginning of the Trump administration, there\u2019s finally\
      \ an opportunity for a radical restructuring of the government.\n\nBut Trump\u2019\
      s plans to aggressively winnow the size and scope of federal agencies may prove\
      \ tough to implement.\n\n\u201CI think I can say with high confidence that this\
      \ will be more complicated than the president has outlined,\u201D Eilperin says.\n\
      \nListen to the full episode.\n\nEach week, \u201CCan He Do That?\u201D explores\

    text: "\n\nPresident Trump's company revealed Friday how much foreign profit it\
      \ had donated to the U.S. Treasury. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThis post has been updated\n\
      \nPresident Trump's hotels made $151,470 in profit from doing business with\
      \ foreign governments in 2017, the Trump Organization announced Friday.\n\n\
      The company donated that amount to the U.S. Treasury in late February, in keeping\
      \ with a promise that Trump made before he was inaugurated.\n\n\u201CAlthough\
      \ we are not legally obligated to do this, we have pledged to account for all\
      \ profits from foreign government business at our hotels and clubs and have\
      \ donated that money back to the United States of America,\u201D Eric Trump,\
      \ the president's son, wrote in an emailed statement. \u201CWe understand the\
      \ bigger picture and believe it is simply the right thing to do.\u201D\n\nThe\
      \ Trump Organization announced several days ago that it had made the donation\
      \ \u2014 but at first, declined to give the amount. That seemed to undercut\
      \ the purpose of the donation, which was to reassure Americans that foreign\
      \ governments are not using Trump's businesses to buy the president's favor.\n\
      \nThis week, however, the company had come under increased scrutiny from Capitol\
      \ Hill. Both Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) \u2014\
      \ respectively, the top Democrats on the Finance and Foreign Relations committees\
      \ \u2014 had sent letters asking for more information about the gift.\n\nThe\
      \ amount of the donation was first reported Friday by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe\
      \ Trump Organization did not release any details about how the donation was\
      \ calculated, other than to say it was in accordance with \u201Cour policy\u201D\
      \ and common accounting standards.\n\nSeveral foreign governments are known\
      \ to have spent significant amounts at Trump's D.C. hotel: The Saudi government\
      \ spent more than $250,000 on hotel rooms, and the embassies of Kuwait, Bahrain\
      \ and Azerbaijan held events in the ballrooms.\n\nTrump says he has shifted\
      \ day-to-day control of his business to his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump\
      \ Jr. But the president still owns those businesses and can withdraw money from\
      \ them at any time.\n\nIn his statement, Eric Trump said that the organization\
      \ tries to avoid business from foreign governments. One reason, he said, is\
      \ that he has pledged to donate the profits from those transactions. The other\
      \ was that \u201Cwe purposely want to avoid any and all instances where anyone\
      \ could claim 'impropriety,' \" he added.\n\nIn recent days, before the amount\
      \ of the donation was revealed, The Washington Post had asked readers to guess\
      \ the amount. Readers submitted 367 responses. The Post's readers largely guessed\
      \ low: The average of their responses was about $26,000."

    text: "The Trump administration sent mixed signals Sunday about its new aluminum\
      \ and steel tariffs, saying that any exceptions for allies are unlikely but\
      \ also leaving room for an unpredictable president to change his mind.\n\nWhite\
      \ House trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared to draw a firm line against case-by-case\
      \ exemptions as he defended President Trump's sudden imposition of new trade\
      \ premiums, which are likely to hit Canada and Europe hardest.\n\n\u201CThat's\
      \ not his decision,\u201D Navarro said when asked about the possibility of exemptions\
      \ in an interview on \u201CFox News Sunday.\u201D \u201CAs soon as he starts\
      \ exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,\u201D the\
      \ adviser said when asked about Canada and the European Union. \u201CAs soon\
      \ as he exempts one country, his phone starts ringing with the heads of state\
      \ of other countries.\u201D\n\nIn a separate interview on CNN, Navarro suggested\
      \ Trump could indeed grant exceptions if doing so would serve U.S. interests.\
      \ Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that although he does not expect Trump\
      \ to change his mind, he does not rule it out.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including\
      \ Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), called the tariff decision wrongheaded and\
      \ misdirected. Trump isn't even punishing China, the country that might deserve\
      \ it, Graham said.\n\n\u201CPlease reconsider,\u201D Graham said in a direct\
      \ appeal to Trump on CBS's \u201CFace the Nation.\u201D\n\nThe decision would\
      \ hurt automobile manufacturing in his state while \u201Cletting China off the\
      \ hook,\u201D Graham said.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re punishing the American taxpayers,\
      \ and you are making a huge mistake,\u201D the senator said.\n\nBritish Prime\
      \ Minister Theresa May was among the first to raise concerns directly with Trump,\
      \ asking for a reconsideration of a policy opposed by many in his own party\
      \ and the White House, and one that close allies say will start a global trade\
      \ war.\n\nMay's office said she spoke with Trump on Sunday morning and \u201C\
      raised our deep concern at the president\u2019s forthcoming announcement on\
      \ steel and aluminum tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way\
      \ to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties\u2019 interests.\u201D\
      \n\nThe White House did not immediately release its own statement on the call.\n\
      \nIn a contentious interview with \u201CFox News Sunday\u201D host Chris Wallace,\
      \ Navarro insisted that other countries won't retaliate in a way that hurts\
      \ U.S. consumers, something disputed by many economists and some Republican\
      \ lawmakers.\n\n\u201CThere are no downstream price effects on our industries\
      \ that are significant,\u201D Navarro said on Fox, one of several interviews\
      \ he did Sunday as the administration sought to promote and defend the decision.\n\
      \nIn several interviews, Navarro asserted that the cost to U.S. consumers from\
      \ any retaliatory actions would be a penny or two on a \u201Csix-pack of beer\
      \ or Coke\u201D and that Americans would be willing to pay a small penalty for\
      \ the security of preserving domestic aluminum and steel production. Interviewers\
      \ challenged his math and his premise.\n\nTrump blurted out the tariff decision,\
      \ including the percentages on both kinds of imports, during a White House meeting\
      \ last week. A formal announcement is expected by the end of this week, administration\
      \ officials said Sunday.\n\n[ China slams Trump's trade announcement ]\n\nThe\
      \ biggest burden of Trump\u2019s new tariffs would be borne by Canada, the largest\
      \ U.S. trading partner. It is the largest exporter of steel and aluminum to\
      \ the United States, supplying $7.2 billion worth of aluminum and $4.3 billion\
      \ of steel last year. Overall, the United States runs a trade surplus with Canada,\
      \ which buys $48 billion worth of U.S. automobiles and $40 billion of machinery,\
      \ in addition to agricultural products.\n\nThe steel and aluminum tariffs would\
      \ also hit Britain, Germany, South Korea, Turkey and Japan, countries with which\
      \ the United States has close national security ties.\n\nThe E.U. has threatened\
      \ retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods, including motorcycles and\
      \ blue jeans, and the worry is that the tit for tat will harm American businesses\
      \ that export while raising costs for businesses that rely on a global supply\
      \ chain.\n\nNavarro said on Fox that the national security provision Trump cited\
      \ in announcing the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum\
      \ is \u201Ccountry-agnostic,\u201D meaning that it applies across the board.\n\
      \nBut speaking on CNN, Navarro suggested there could be exemptions in \u201C\
      particular cases where we need to have exemptions so that business can move\
      \ forward.\u201D\n\nIn the same interview, he also pushed back on the Pentagon\u2019\
      s argument that the new trade policy could have an adverse effect on national\
      \ security, arguing against giving allies a pass on the tariffs because \u201C\
      as soon as you exempt one country, then you have to exempt another country.\u201D\
      \n\nAllies are concerned about the tariffs because they supply more steel directly\
      \ to the United States than does China \u2014 which dominates a major part of\
      \ the global steel trade and Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201CIf you exempt Canada,\
      \ then you have to put big tariffs on everybody else,\u201D Navarro said on\
      \ CNN.\n\nTrump is facing criticism from members of his own party over his trade\
      \ plan, including from some of the top economists who advised his campaign.\
      \ Navarro brushed off the criticism, arguing that Trump was alone in the GOP\
      \ on trade during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 and won anyway.\n\n\u201C\
      All 16 of those candidates didn\u2019t agree with his policies, either,\u201D\
      \ Navarro said on CNN. \u201CThey\u2019re dead wrong on the economics; there\u2019\
      s no downstream effect here. There\u2019s only a president \u2026 saving and\
      \ defending our aluminum and steel industries.\u201D\n\nRoss, appearing on ABC's\
      \ \u201CThis Week,\u201D said he expects the formal rollout of the tariffs this\
      \ week.\n\n\u201CI have not heard him describe particular exemptions,\u201D\
      \ Ross said.\n\nAs for speculation that White House economic adviser Gary Cohn\
      \ might quit over the new policy, with which he apparently disagrees, Ross said\
      \ Trump likes to hear opposing views before he makes decisions.\n\n\u201CGary\
      \ Cohn, as far as I know, is certainly not going to walk out,\u201D Ross said\
      \ on ABC.\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \u201CMeet the Press,\u201D Ross said\
      \ he \u201Chas no reason to think\u201D that Trump will reverse himself under\
      \ pressure, but he did not rule it out.\n\n\u201CWhatever his final decision\
      \ is is what will happen,\u201D Ross said. \u201CWhat he has said he has said;\
      \ if he says something different, it'll be something different.\u201D\n\nNavarro\
      \ cast the decision as a national security imperative to protect vital manufacturing\
      \ industries at home and said Trump is acting to fulfill a campaign promise\
      \ to U.S. workers.\n\nEconomists warn that any benefit in terms of jobs could\
      \ be far outweighed by increased steel costs for U.S. automobiles, wind turbines,\
      \ shale oil and gas drilling rigs, and more.\n\nHours after Navarro and Ross\
      \ made the rounds, Trump underscored his intention to move ahead with tariffs.\n\
      \n\"We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals,\" he tweeted. \"Our\
      \ friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel\
      \ and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change! MAKE AMERICA\
      \ GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\n[ Trump vows to strike back if EU imposes retaliatory tariffs\
      \ ]\n\nIn Twitter posts on Saturday, Trump vowed to strike back at European\
      \ leaders who said they would retaliate.\n\n\u201CIf the E.U. wants to further\
      \ increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing\
      \ business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour\
      \ into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there.\
      \ Big trade imbalance!\u201D he tweeted.\n\nNavarro accused Wallace, the Fox\
      \ host, of \u201Cfanning the flames\u201D of a trade war, and he bristled when\
      \ asked on CNN whether the Trump administration would consider pulling the United\
      \ States out of the World Trade Organization.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s a provocative\
      \ question,\u201D he said. \u201CThe best-case scenario here is that the World\
      \ Trade Organization wakes up and realizes we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201D\
      \n\nThe Wall Street Journal has called the steel and aluminum tariffs the single\
      \ worst policy decision of Trump's young presidency.\n\nTrump, however, got\
      \ a boost Sunday from Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who said on CNN that the\
      \ president\u2019s tariff plan was \u201Cwelcome.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn West Virginia,\
      \ we\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of jobs,\u201D Manchin said. \u201C\
      When you look at who produces the steel in the world, 50 percent of the steel\
      \ comes from China. \u2026 Connect the dots.\u201D\n\n\u201CEven if they\u2019\
      re saying it might not come directly,\u201D he said, \u201Cthe president has\
      \ put this on the table; I welcome it. Let\u2019s look at it and see what they\
      \ roll out.\u201D\n\nOn CBS, Manchin said trade should be \u201Ctit for tat.\u201D\
      \n\n\u201CFree trade hasn't worked well for West Virginia,\u201D the senator\
      \ said.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R), also appearing on CNN, excoriated the\

      \ month. North Korea has vowed it will not give up its nuclear weapons, but\
      \ the United States insists that any negotiations to lower tensions would have\
      \ the goal of denuclearization.\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump was describing\
      \ a direct conversation or messages sent through diplomatic channels. Trump\
      \ has previously said he thinks he could have a good relationship with Kim,\
      \ were they ever to try to resolve tensions directly. A U.S. official said earlier\
      \ this year that Trump and Kim had never spoken.\n\nNorth Korea greatly accelerated\
      \ its testing of ballistic missiles last year and claims it can deliver a nuclear\
      \ weapon anywhere in the United States. U.S. officials dispute the claim but\

      Trump has vowed not to repeat what he calls the mistakes of past administrations\
      \ that negotiated with North Korea. Talks never stopped North Korea from pursuing\
      \ weapons and left the United States looking weak, Trump has said. He said last\
      \ year that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was wasting his time trying to\
      \ open talks, but he has more recently said he would consider them under the\
      \ right conditions.\n\nTrump has not laid out how any future negotiations would\
      \ be structured, except to say that North Korea's nuclear weapons must be on\
      \ the table.\n\nTrump spoke Saturday at a press dinner, where some of his remarks\
      \ were in jest.\n\n\u201CI would not rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un,\u201D\
      \ Trump said in a lighthearted tone. \u201CI just won't. As far as the risk\
      \ of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine,\u201D\
      \ he said to laughter. \u201CHe must be a fine man.\u201D\n\nTurning serious,\
      \ Trump also said the United States \u201Csaved the Olympics\u201D by taking\
      \ a hard line on North Korea. South Korea, the host of the games, credits Trump's\
      \ \u201Cstrong attitude\u201D for North Korea's attendance, he said.\n\n\u201C\
      That's true, whether people want to hear it,\u201D Trump said at the Gridiron\

      \ of an American tradition.\n\nThe Kennedys did it. So did the Carters, the\

      \n[ \u2018Jared has faded\u2019: Inside the 28 days of tumult that left Kushner\

      \ and several other staffers have been working without permanent security clearances\
      \ since the beginning of the administration \u2014 a major point of concern,\

      \ which has led to confusion over what policies he wants Congress to advance.\
      \ Trump shocked lawmakers from both parties Wednesday during an hour-long televised\

      \ he wants to arm some teachers and school staff with weapons to help fight\
      \ back against perpetrators.\n\n[ Trump\u2019s gun meeting went off the rails\
      \ quickly ]\n\nSanders sought to downplay the idea Trump has not been consistent\
      \ about what he wants.\n\nShe reiterated that Trump supports a bill from Sens.\
      \ John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that would require federal\
      \ and state agencies to report relevant criminal history records to the National\
      \ Instant Criminal Background Check System. Trump called Cornyn on Thursday\
      \ to reiterate his support for that bill, according to a person familiar with\
      \ the call.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) challenged\
      \ Trump to \u201Cgo with his instincts, not the clarion and destructive call\
      \ of the NRA.\u201D\n\nSchumer added that Trump \u201Cknows instinctively that\
      \ this is the right thing to do both substantively, because it will save tens\
      \ of thousands of lives, and politically because over three quarters of the\
      \ American people support it. If he continues to bow to his right wing ringmasters,\
      \ we will get nothing done on guns and his presidency will continue to fail.\u201D\

    text: "\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions attends a Feb. 22 meeting with President\
      \ Trump and state and local officials on school safety at the White House. (Getty\
      \ Images)\n\nIn this occasional series, we will bring you up to speed on the\
      \ biggest national security stories of the week.\n\n1. Can President Trump fire\
      \ Attorney General Jeff Sessions? What are the consequences?\n\nYes. Cabinet\
      \ officials serve at the pleasure of the president and can be fired for any\
      \ cause or no cause. However, the politics and legality of firing this particular\
      \ official at this particular time would be fraught, because special counsel\
      \ Robert S. Mueller III is already investigating Trump\u2019s intentions around\
      \ his repeated attempts to force or shame Sessions into quitting, to determine\
      \ whether those efforts are part of a broader pattern of attempted obstruction\
      \ of justice. Firing Sessions, a former senator from Alabama, could provoke\
      \ a fierce response in Congress, where many Republicans are still very supportive\
      \ of their former colleague and where many Democrats fear that the president\
      \ is willing to tear apart the Justice Department to torpedo the Russia probe.\n\
      \n2. If Trump fires Sessions, who would step in? What would happen to the Russia\
      \ investigation?\n\nIt depends on how he does it. If he appointed a temporary\
      \ replacement, that person could, in theory, take over supervision of the Russian\
      \ probe from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Rosenstein has been\
      \ overseeing the Russia probe because Sessions recused himself from investigative\
      \ matters related to the 2016 campaign. Alternately, if Sessions were fired,\
      \ Rosenstein could assume the title of acting attorney general, in which case\
      \ the same person would be overseeing the Russia probe, but that person would\
      \ also be the top official at the Justice Department.\n\n3. Has Sessions ever\
      \ fired back against Trump?\n\nSessions has generally laid low when the president\
      \ publicly criticizes him. On Wednesday, after the president attacked the attorney\
      \ general in a tweet pushing for a more aggressive investigation of alleged\
      \ surveillance abuses against a former Trump campaign aide, Sessions took the\
      \ rare step of issuing a statement, saying that as long as he was the attorney\
      \ general, he would continue to do the job \u201Cwith integrity and honor.\u201D\
      \ The statement suggests that Sessions felt Wednesday\u2019s attack was more\
      \ alarming than previous complaints from the president.\n\n4. How unusual is\
      \ it for the president to criticize the attorney general so publicly?\n\nIt\
      \ is very unusual. Presidents have been known to grouse privately about their\
      \ attorney general or FBI director. What Trump has done, though, is regularly\
      \ air his dislike of his attorney general, which current and former Justice\
      \ Department officials have called a worrisome sign for the long-term credibility\
      \ and stability of the department. Part of the reason Trump\u2019s critics are\
      \ so alarmed by his comments about Sessions is that he appears to want Sessions\
      \ to use the department\u2019s investigative powers to fight the president\u2019\
      s political battles.\n\n5. Will Sessions continue to take the criticism?\n\n\
      The attorney general\u2019s statement Wednesday seemed to be a reassertion that\
      \ he has no plans to resign and is willing to endure public ridicule from the\
      \ commander in chief to stay in the job. Trump\u2019s broadsides have had an\
      \ odd political effect \u2014 while many Democrats disagree with Sessions and\
      \ distrust his stewardship of the department, they also fear that if Sessions\
      \ were forced out, what follows could be more partisan and tumultuous."

    text: "A federal judge on Thursday denied a request from Stormy Daniels, who says\
      \ she was paid to remain silent about an affair with President Trump, to expedite\
      \ a jury trial in her lawsuit against the president.\n\nThe request for an expedited\
      \ jury trial and limited discovery \u2014 including a deposition of Trump and\
      \ his personal attorney, Michael Cohen \u2014 was deemed \u201Cpremature and\
      \ must be denied\u201D because some questions may wind up being answered by\
      \ a future petition from Trump and Cohen, wrote Judge S. James Otero of the\
      \ U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe ruling\
      \ looked like a temporary setback for Daniels\u2019s case, but it also opens\
      \ Trump\u2019s legal team to exposure.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie\
      \ Clifford, filed a lawsuit against Trump earlier this month, asking the court\
      \ to declare her nondisclosure agreement reached in the final days of the 2016\
      \ presidential election invalid because the then-Republican candidate never\
      \ signed it.\n\nThe judge's denial came a little more than a day after Michael\
      \ J. Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, filed the motion seeking to depose Trump\
      \ and Cohen in the case. Cohen has said he paid Daniels the $130,000 out of\
      \ his own funds, while the White House has denied that Trump had an affair with\
      \ Daniels.\n\n[ Stormy Daniels\u2019s lawyer pushes to depose Trump and says\
      \ Americans have been told \u2018a bucket of lies\u2019 ]\n\nIn his filing,\
      \ Avenatti argued that his side told attorneys for Trump and Cohen last week\
      \ that they would seek \u201Climited discovery on an expedited basis\u201D in\
      \ the case that included deposing both Trump and Cohen as well as requesting\
      \ certain documents. Avenatti wrote in the filing that the attorneys for Trump\
      \ and Cohen \u201Ccontend that no discovery should be conducted in the case,\
      \ and no trial should be set, because the case should be summarily ordered to\
      \ arbitration.\u201D\n\nCohen has claimed in court filings that he has a right\
      \ to seek at least $20 million in damages from Daniels for violating the nondisclosure\
      \ agreement. Court filings made on behalf of Cohen's limited liability company,\
      \ Essential Consultants, and Trump also said they intended to push the case\
      \ back into arbitration, which would be shielded from the public eye.\n\n\u201C\
      While [Essential Consultants] and Mr. Trump have stated their intention to file\
      \ a petition to compel arbitration, they have not yet done so,\u201D Otero wrote\
      \ in his order Thursday. \u201CIf such a petition were filed, a number of the\
      \ questions raised in plaintiff's motion may be answered in the petition, thus\
      \ limiting the need for discovery on these issues. If such a petition is never\
      \ filed, plaintiff's motion is moot. Accordingly, plaintiff's motion is premature\
      \ and must be denied.\u201D\n\nAttorneys for Trump and Cohen did not immediately\
      \ respond to messages seeking comment about Otero's order Thursday.\n\n[ After\
      \ Stormy Daniels tells her story on \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 Trump associate\
      \ denies account of threats ]\n\nAvenatti said in a telephone interview Thursday\
      \ that the language as it relates \u201Cto the law and the merits is very, very\
      \ positive for us and shows that the court appears to agree with our position.\
      \ This does not bode well for the president or Mr. Cohen.\u201D\n\nHe also posted\
      \ on Twitter a section of the judge's order, arguing that this suggests Otero\
      \ \u201Cwill ultimately agree with our requests for discovery and a trial.\u201D\
      \n\nThese passages in the Court's order do not bode well for the defendants\
      \ and suggest that there is a strong likelihood that the Court will ultimately\
      \ agree with our requests for discovery and a trial. They also destroy David\
      \ Schwartz's claims that the motion was without merit. pic.twitter.com/D1DmGkku1E\
      \ \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 29, 2018\n\nLegal experts\
      \ said Otero made the right decision on Thursday.\n\n\u201CAt this stage, the\
      \ court has to determine the validity of the purported contract between Trump\
      \ and Daniels,\u201D David A. Super, a professor of law at Georgetown University,\
      \ wrote in an email. \u201CIf that contract were valid, the court likely would\
      \ have no jurisdiction over this matter. And making that determination does\
      \ not require any depositions: the contract is invalid on its face. Once the\
      \ court has determined that the contract is invalid, it can move on to deciding\
      \ whether any other claims, such as those relating to alleged intimidation,\
      \ are sufficiently substantial to allow the case to go forward.\u201D\n\nShould\
      \ that happen, \u201Cdepositions might well be in order,\u201D Super said. \u201C\
      But depositions now would be premature.\u201D\n\nStephen Gillers of New York\
      \ University Law School similarly said that it was too soon to discuss deposing\
      \ the president.\n\n\u201CThere is no urgency,\u201D he wrote in an email. \u201C\
      Deliberation is paramount. The court should wait until the close of pleadings\
      \ and the legal question can be briefed.\u201D\n\nThe order comes as Daniels's\
      \ allegations against Trump and her lawsuit have received intense media scrutiny\
      \ recently. Daniels made a widely seen appearance Sunday night on \"60 Minutes\u201D\
      \ during which she repeated her claims about beginning an affair with Trump\
      \ in 2006 and then being paid to remain silent shortly before he was elected\
      \ president a decade later.\n\nDaniels, who has told journalists she had the\
      \ affair and also released statements denying it, said on \"60 Minutes\u201D\
      \ that she was threatened for trying to tell the story publicly in 2011 and\
      \ took the $130,000 payment because she feared for her family. The interviewed\
      \ prompted questions about her credibility. A lawyer for Cohen and a spokesman\
      \ for Trump both said the men did not believe that she was threatened in 2011,\
      \ while Keith Davidson, Daniels's former lawyer, said he did \u201Cnot believe\
      \ that the assertions in Ms. Daniels\u2019 \u201860 Minutes\u2019 interview\
      \ represents a fair and accurate description of the situation.\u201D\n\n[ Playmate,\
      \ porn star and reality TV contestant in court over Trump ]\n\nCohen, who initially\
      \ dismissed stories about the payout before acknowledging he sent $130,000 to\
      \ Daniels, has argued that neither Trump's campaign nor the president's business\
      \ were involved in the payment. David Schwartz, an attorney for Cohen, argued\
      \ Thursday that the lawyer \u201Cnever told\u201D Trump about the agreement.\n\
      \n\u201CMichael Cohen had great authority within that organization to take care\
      \ of things,\u201D Schwartz said during an appearance on NBC's \u201CMegyn Kelly\
      \ Today.\u201D Schwartz said Cohen \u201Cchose not to go to the boss, he chose\
      \ to take care of this thing.\u201D\n\nOtero, who was nominated to the bench\
      \ by President George W. Bush in 2003, also included an admonition for those\
      \ involved in the high-profile case.\n\n\u201CThe parties are advised that the\
      \ instant litigation is not the most important matter on the court's docket,\u201D\
      \ Otero wrote in a footnote attached to the four-page order. \u201CRequests\
      \ for expedited proceedings, hearings, and discovery not clearly supported by\
      \ the record and law are discouraged.\u201D\n\nFurther reading:\n\nAs Stormy\

    text: "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump spent his Easter morning here on\
      \ an anti-immigrant tirade, declaring Sunday that there would be no deal to\
      \ legalize the status of undocumented immigrants known as \u201Cdreamers\u201D\
      \ and threatening to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement unless Mexico\

      \ promising \u201CNO MORE DACA DEAL,\u201D and he directed congressional Republicans\
      \ to pass tough anti-immigration legislation.\n\nAn hour after he wished Americans\
      \ a \u201CHAPPY EASTER,\u201D Trump fired off three tweets in which he vented,\
      \ sometimes in all caps, about immigration laws he derided as \u201Cridiculous\u201D\
      \ and \u201Cdumb\u201D and about border enforcement he deemed dangerously lax.\n\
      \nIn his first of the immigration-related tweets, Trump wrote, \u201CBorder\

      \ since 2007, have arrived in the country before age 16 and have been younger\
      \ than 31 on June 15, 2012. No one arriving in the country after that date is\
      \ eligible.\n\nAfter canceling DACA, Trump said he would like to reach a deal\
      \ with Congress to protect dreamers from deportation in exchange for funding\
      \ to build his long-promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The president,\
      \ however, went on to reject immigration proposals from congressional Democrats\

      \ had a comment or statement Sunday afternoon. At Breitbart, the tweets were\
      \ reported as Trump refusing to \u201Cnegotiate a deal between the GOP establishment\
      \ and Democrats,\u201D in \u201Ca return to his \u2018America First\u2019 immigration\
      \ agenda.\u201D\n\nOn Facebook, the conservative author Ann Coulter, who had\
      \ condemned Trump for not securing border wall funding so far this year, urged\
      \ the president to show and not tell.\n\n\u201CTry to get a message to the commander\
      \ in chief for that wall,\u201D she wrote.\n\nBut some Republicans joined the\
      \ chorus of criticism. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a GOP primary opponent of Trump\
      \ in 2016 and possibly again in 2020, tweeted in response: \u201CA true leader\
      \ preserves & offers hope, doesn\u2019t take hope from innocent children who\
      \ call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday. #DACA #Hope\u201D\n\n\
      Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), a supporter of immigration reform who represents\
      \ Miami and is retiring this year, took a sarcastic approach: \u201CSuch a strong\
      \ message of love and new beginnings from @realDonaldTrump on Easter Sunday.\u201D\
      \n\nBy calling for Republicans to use the \u201CNuclear Option\u201D to pass\
      \ tough immigration measures, Trump seemed to urge a parliamentary procedure\
      \ by which Senate Republicans could pass legislation with a simple majority\
      \ of 51 votes as opposed to the 60-vote majority required to end debate and\
      \ bring a vote to the floor.\n\nBut in mid-February, just 36 of the Senate\u2019\
      s 51 Republicans backed an immigration bill that mirrored White House demands.\
      \ Congressional negotiations on DACA stalled just weeks later, when the Supreme\
      \ Court upheld a decision that prevented the Trump administration from denying\
      \ new program renewals.\n\nThe court\u2019s move effectively nixed a March 6\
      \ deadline that the administration had set for ending DACA. Before leaving for\
      \ Easter recess, Congress passed an omnibus spending bill with no DACA fix,\
      \ even though advocates saw that as the best must-pass vehicle for one.\n\n\
      Trump lashed out at Mexico in his second of the three tweets Sunday. He threatened\
      \ to \u201Cstop\u201D NAFTA unless Mexican authorities do more to secure the\
      \ border with the United States.\n\nTrump wrote: \u201CMexico is doing very\
      \ little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through\
      \ their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration\

    text: "\n\nPresident Trump speaks at the White House last month. (Manuel Balce\
      \ Ceneta/AP)\n\nAttorneys for President Trump said this week that they are appealing\
      \ a New York judge's decision to allow a former \u201CApprentice\u201D contestant\u2019\
      s defamation lawsuit against him to proceed.\n\nThey filed the appeal less than\
      \ two weeks after New York Supreme Court Justice Jennifer G. Schecter rejected\
      \ attempts by Trump's attorneys to block Summer Zervos's lawsuit, one of multiple\
      \ legal cases the president is facing. Trump's attorneys argued that Schecter's\
      \ ruling was mistaken in not dismissing or at least temporarily staying the\
      \ case.\n\nZervos had accused Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign of\
      \ groping her years earlier, charges he denied. Days before Trump took office,\
      \ Zervos filed a defamation suit, after he said all of the women accusing him\
      \ of unwanted sexual contact were lying. Trump's attorneys have argued that\
      \ he was expressing a political opinion and that he cannot be sued in state\
      \ court while president.\n\n[ Judge rules defamation case against Trump may\
      \ proceed ]\n\nIn her opinion released March 20, Schecter rebuffed their arguments,\
      \ writing, \u201CNo one is above the law.\u201D She cited court precedent that\
      \ ultimately led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 in finding\
      \ that \u201Ca sitting president is not immune from being sued in federal court\
      \ for unofficial acts.\u201D She also denied a request that the case be stayed\
      \ while Trump is in office and wrote that Trump\u2019s comments calling Zervos\
      \ a liar \u201Ccannot be characterized simply as opinion, heated rhetoric or\
      \ hyperbole.\u201D\n\nTrump's attorneys, in their filing Sunday, reiterated\
      \ some of their earlier arguments in appealing the case, including that the\
      \ president is outside the jurisdiction of a state court and that Schecter \u201C\
      erred in denying a temporary stay of proceedings ... because without a stay,\
      \ this action will\u201D impair Trump's abilities to fulfill his constitutional\
      \ obligations.\n\nHis attorneys also wrote that Zervos and her lawyers \u201C\
      have stated repeatedly that the true object of this lawsuit is political\u201D\
      \ and said Trump's \u201Cstatements were non-defamatory opinions made in quintessentially\
      \ political forums during a political campaign that fall under the highest,\
      \ core protections of the First Amendment.\u201D\n\nMariann Meier Wang, Zervos's\
      \ attorney, said Monday, \u201CWe believe the court\u2019s well-reasoned decision\
      \ will be upheld, and look forward to proving Ms. Zervos\u2019s claim.\u201D\
      \n\nAn appeal from Trump's attorneys was expected, and the notice filed this\
      \ week is just a preliminary step. Court documents show that the appeal will\
      \ probably not be heard before September.\n\nDavid Ferstendig, an expert on\
      \ legal procedure in New York, said that based on his experience, he thinks\
      \ a decision could be reached in about 30 to 60 days once the appeal is heard.\n\
      \n\u201CI don\u2019t see them sitting on it,\u201D he said.\n\n[ Playmate, porn\
      \ star and reality-TV contestant in court over Trump ]\n\nMichael Martin, a\
      \ professor at the Fordham University School of Law, said that \u201Cit is almost\
      \ always to the defendant\u2019s advantage to try to delay\u201D a case. He\
      \ described Trump as \u201Csomebody who has all kinds of incentives not to want\
      \ to get to a resolution \u2014 or even to get to the discovery.\u201D\n\nThe\
      \ defendant can ask the judge \u2013 in this case Schecter -- to stay the discovery\
      \ process, and if she denies that request, take it to the appellate court which\
      \ can overrule her, according to Stephen Gillers of New York University Law\
      \ School.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz did not immediately\
      \ respond to a request for comment regarding the filing.\n\nZervos last week\
      \ shifted her legal representation, with Gloria Allred, a prominent women's\
      \ rights lawyer who had been representing Zervos, saying she was withdrawing\
      \ from the case. Zervos said in a statement last week that she chose to split\
      \ with Allred, describing it as a choice made \u201Cpurely for personal reasons.\u201D\
      \ Allred, in her own statement, said the withdrawal had no connection with the\
      \ case's merits.\n\nWhen Zervos made her public allegations against Trump in\
      \ October 2016, she spoke at a news conference alongside Allred, who has also\
      \ represented some of the other women who have accused Trump of unwanted sexual\
      \ contact. Allred said she continues to represent these other women. Wang, who\
      \ had been Allred\u2019s New York-based co-counsel in Zervos's case, said she\
      \ will continue to represent the former \u201CApprentice\u201D contestant.\n\
      \nTrump is also confronting legal and political headaches in cases involving\
      \ adult-film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal,\
      \ both of whom have filed lawsuits seeking the rights to tell their stories\
      \ publicly. Meanwhile, multiple legal teams are seeking to peek inside the Trump\
      \ Organization's books and records.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nLawyer Gloria Allred\
      \ withdraws from Summer Zervos\u2019s defamation suit against Trump\n\nFrom\
      \ Mueller to Stormy to \u2018emoluments,\u2019 Trump\u2019s business is under\
      \ siege\n\nJudge denies Stormy Daniels\u2019s bid to expedite case against Trump\
